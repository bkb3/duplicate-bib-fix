  abstract = "Synonymous codon choice can have dramatic effects on ribosome
              speed and protein expression. Ribosome profiling experiments have
              underscored that ribosomes do not move uniformly along mRNAs.
              Here, we have modeled this variation in translation elongation by
              using a feed-forward neural network to predict the ribosome
              density at each codon as a function of its sequence neighborhood.
              Our approach revealed sequence features affecting translation
              elongation and characterized large technical biases in ribosome
              profiling. We applied our model to design synonymous variants of
              a fluorescent protein spanning the range of translation speeds
              predicted with our model. Levels of the fluorescent protein in
              budding yeast closely tracked the predicted translation speeds
              across their full range. We therefore demonstrate that our model
              captures information determining translation dynamics in vivo;
              that this information can be harnessed to design coding
              sequences; and that control of translation elongation alone is
              sufficient to produce large quantitative differences in protein
              output.",

              samples using\textit{Escherichia coli}host vectors. The platform is
              centered on 6X-His affinity-tagged protein constructs, allowing
              for a similar purification procedure for most targets, and the
              implementation of high-throughput parallel methods. In most
              cases, these affinity-purified proteins are sufficiently
              homogeneous that a single subsequent gel filtration
              chromatography step is adequate to produce protein preparations
              that are greater than 98\% pure. Using this platform, over 1000
              different proteins have been cloned, expressed, and purified in
              tens of milligram quantities over the last 36-month period (see
              Summary Statistics for All Targets, ). Our experience using a
              hierarchical multiplex expression and purification strategy, also
              described in this chapter, has allowed us to achieve success in
              producing not only protein samples but also many
              three-dimensional structures. As of December 2004, the NESG
              Consortium has deposited over 145 new protein structures to the
              Protein Data Bank (PDB); about two-thirds of these protein
              samples were produced by the NESG Protein Production Facility
              described here. The methods described here have proven effective
              in producing quality samples of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic
              proteins. These improved robotic and?or parallel cloning,
              expression, protein production, and biophysical screening

              proteome-wide quantification is not yet fully routine, many
              datasets approaching proteome-wide coverage are becoming
              available through biophysical and MS techniques. Data of this
              type can be accessed via a variety of sources, including
              publication supplements and online data repositories. However,
              access to the data is still fragmentary, and comparisons across
              experiments and organisms are not straightforward. Here, we
              describe recent updates to our database resource ``PaxDb''
              (Protein Abundances Across Organisms). PaxDb focuses on protein
              abundance information at proteome-wide scope, irrespective of the
              underlying measurement technique. Quantification data is
              reprocessed, unified, and quality-scored, and then integrated to
              build a meta-resource. PaxDb also allows evolutionary comparisons
              through precomputed gene orthology relations. Recently, we have
              expanded the scope of the database to include cell-line samples,
              and more systematically scan the literature for suitable
              datasets. We report that a significant fraction of published
              experiments cannot readily be accessed and/or parsed for
              quantitative information, requiring additional steps and efforts.
              The current update brings PaxDb to 414 datasets in 53 organisms,

              the performance of other sequence analyses. In response to the
              rapid increase in the amount of sequencing data produced by the
              next-generation sequencing technologies, we have developed a new
              CD-HIT program accelerated with a novel parallelization strategy
              and some other techniques to allow efficient clustering of such
              datasets. Our tests demonstrated very good speedup derived from
              the parallelization for up to ∼24 cores and a quasi-linear
              speedup for up to ∼8 cores. The enhanced CD-HIT is capable of
              handling very large datasets in much shorter time than previous

              which this effect is achieved are controversial; although some
              previous studies have suggested that codon bias is the most
              important determinant of translation efficiency, a recent study
              suggested that mRNA folding at the beginning of genes is the
              dominant factor via its effect on translation initiation. Using
              the\textit{Escherichia coli}and Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcriptomes,
              we conducted a genome-scale study aiming at dissecting the
              determinants of translation efficiency. There is a significant
              association between codon bias and translation efficiency across
              all endogenous genes in E. coli and S. cerevisiae but no
              association between folding energy and translation efficiency,
              demonstrating the role of codon bias as an important determinant
              of translation efficiency. However, folding energy does modulate
              the strength of association between codon bias and translation
              efficiency, which is maximized at very weak mRNA folding (i.e.,
              high folding energy) levels. We find a strong correlation between
              the genomic profiles of ribosomal density and genomic profiles of
              folding energy across mRNA, suggesting that lower folding
              energies slow down the ribosomes and decrease translation
              efficiency. Accordingly, we find that selection forces act near
              uniformly to decrease the folding energy at the beginning of
              genes. In summary, these findings testify that in endogenous
              genes, folding energy affects translation efficiency in a global
              manner that is not related to the expression levels of individual
              genes, and thus cannot be detected by correlation with their

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: An important problem in synthetic biology is to
              design a nucleotide sequence of an mRNA that confers a desirable
              expression level of a target protein. The secondary structure of
              protein-coding sequences (CDSs) is one potential factor that
              could have both positive and negative effects on protein
              production. To elucidate the role of secondary structure in CDSs,
              algorithms for manipulating secondary structure should be
              developed. RESULTS: We developed an algorithm for designing a CDS
              with the most stable secondary structure among all possible ones
              translated into the same protein, and implemented it as the
              program CDSfold. The algorithm runs the Zuker algorithm under the
              constraint of a given amino acid sequence. The time and space
              complexity is O(L(3)) and O(L(2)), respectively, where L is the
              length of the CDS to be designed. Although our algorithm is
              slower than the original Zuker algorithm, it could design a
              relatively long (2.7-kb) CDS in approximately 1 h. AVAILABILITY

              The most favorable conditions for protein production vary with
              the gene product. Temperature and induction conditions represent
              parameters that affect total protein production, as well as the

              and bacterial strain will have large effects on the production of
              the target protein. In the present study, the effects of three
              different promoters (T7, trc and lacUV5) on E. coli production of
              target proteins with different characteristics are presented. The

              improving protein production by optimizing translation

              how the altered protein coding sequence will affect the secondary
              structure of the corresponding RNA transcript, particularly not
              the effect on the 5'-UTR structure and related ribosome binding
              site availability. This is a serious drawback, because the
              influence of codon usage on mRNA secondary structures, especially
              near the start of a gene, may strongly influence translation
              initiation. In this study, we aim to reduce the effect of codon
              usage on translation initiation by applying a bicistronic design
              (BCD) element. Protein production of several codon-optimized gene
              variants is tested in parallel for a BCD and a standard

              irrespective of the algorithm used, using a BCD does improve

              codon variants having very low expression from the MCD, even
              10-fold to 100-fold increases in expression were achieved by the

              and protein stability shared functional properties, indicating
              that half-lives evolved under energetic and dynamic constraints.

              most efficient way to make functional genetic constructs and
              enables applications such as codon optimization, RNAi resistant
              genes and protein engineering. Here we introduce a software tool
              that drastically facilitates the design of synthetic genes.
              RESULTS: Gene Designer is a stand-alone software for fast and
              easy design of synthetic DNA segments. Users can easily add, edit
              and combine genetic elements such as promoters, open reading
              frames and tags through an intuitive drag-and-drop graphic
              interface and a hierarchical DNA/Protein object map. Using
              advanced optimization algorithms, open reading frames within the
              DNA construct can readily be codon optimized for protein
              expression in any host organism. Gene Designer also includes
              features such as a real-time sliding calculator of
              oligonucleotide annealing temperatures, sequencing primer

              and options to maximize or minimize sequence identity to a

              increasing the robustness or productivity of a microbial

              noise. Indeed, the effective interfacing of microbial physiology
              with external parameters that can be used for controlling

              heterogeneity in productive microbes with environmental cues and

              electronics, signals are perpetually subjected to noise. If

  abstract = "Translation initiation in eukaryotes is a complex process
              involving many factors. A key step in this process is the binding
              of mRNA to the 43S preinitiation complex. This is generally the
              rate-limiting step in translation initiation and consequently a
              major determinant of mRNA translational efficiency. The primary
              and secondary structure of the mRNA 5' noncoding region have been
              implicated in modulating translational efficiency. Translational
              efficiency was shown to be inversely proportional to the degree
              of secondary structure at the mRNA 5' noncoding region.
              Furthermore, it was shown that cap-binding proteins that interact
              with the 5' cap structure (m7GpppN) of eukaryotic mRNAs are
              involved in the ``unwinding'' of the mRNA secondary structure, in
              an ATP hydrolysis mediated event, to facilitate ribosome binding.
              Thus, cap-binding proteins can potentially regulate mRNA
              translation. Here, we discuss the available data supporting the
              notion that eukaryotic 5' mRNA secondary structure plays an
              important role in translation initiation and the possible
              regulation of this process.",

  abstract = "Recently large scale transcriptome and proteome datasets for
              human cells have become available. A striking finding from these
              studies is that the level of an mRNA typically predicts no more
              than 40\% of the abundance of protein. This correlation
              represents the overall figure for all genes. We present here a
              bioinformatic analysis of translation efficiency - the rate at
              which mRNA is translated into protein. We have analysed those
              human datasets that include genome wide mRNA and protein levels
              determined in the same study. The analysis comprises five
              distinct human cell lines that together provide comparable data
              for 8,170 genes. For each gene we have used levels of mRNA and
              protein combined with protein stability data from the HeLa cell
              line to estimate translation efficiency. This was possible for
              3,990 genes in one or more cell lines and 1,807 genes in all five
              cell lines. Interestingly, our analysis and modelling shows that
              for many genes this estimated translation efficiency has
              considerable consistency between cell lines. Some deviations from
              this consistency likely result from the regulation of protein
              degradation. Others are likely due to known translational control
              mechanisms. These findings suggest it will be possible to build
              improved models for the interpretation of mRNA expression data.
              The results we present here provide a view of translation

  abstract = "Secondary structure of messenger RNA plays an important role in
              the bio-synthesis of proteins. Its negative impact on translation
              can reduce the yield of protein by slowing or blocking the
              initiation and movement of ribosomes along the mRNA, becoming a
              major factor in the regulation of gene expression. Several
              algorithms can predict the formation of secondary structures by
              calculating the minimum free energy of RNA sequences, or perform
              the inverse process of obtaining an RNA sequence for a given
              structure. However, there is still no approach to redesign an
              mRNA to achieve minimal secondary structure without affecting the
              amino acid sequence. Here we present the first strategy to
              optimize mRNA secondary structures, to increase (or decrease) the
              minimum free energy of a nucleotide sequence, without changing
              its resulting polypeptide, in a time-efficient manner, through a
              simplistic approximation to hairpin formation. Our data show that
              this approach can efficiently increase the minimum free energy by
              >40\%, strongly reducing the strength of secondary structures.

              optimization of genes by controlling minimum free energy together

              containing a ribosome binding site was varied over 12 kcal/mol (1
              cal = 4.184 J) by site-directed mutagenesis and the effects on
              protein yields were analyzed in vivo. The results reveal a strict
              correlation between translational efficiency and the stability of
              the helix. An increase in its delta G0 of -1.4 kcal/mol (i.e.,
              less than the difference between an A.U and a G.C pair)
              corresponds to the reduction by a factor of 10 in initiation
              rate. Accordingly, a single nucleotide substitution led to the
              decrease by a factor of 500 in expression because it turned a

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: As more non-coding RNAs are discovered, the
              importance of methods for RNA analysis increases. Since the
              structure of ncRNA is intimately tied to the function of the
              molecule, programs for RNA structure prediction are necessary
              tools in this growing field of research. Furthermore, it is known
              that RNA structure is often evolutionarily more conserved than
              sequence. However, few existing methods are capable of
              simultaneously considering multiple sequence alignment and
              structure prediction. RESULT: We present a novel solution to the
              problem of simultaneous structure prediction and multiple
              alignment of RNA sequences. Using Markov chain Monte Carlo in a
              simulated annealing framework, the algorithm MASTR (Multiple
              Alignment of STructural RNAs) iteratively improves both sequence
              alignment and structure prediction for a set of RNA sequences.
              This is done by minimizing a combined cost function that
              considers sequence conservation, covariation and basepairing
              probabilities. The results show that the method is very
              competitive to similar programs available today, both in terms of

              impact of 5'-UTR sequences on protein levels in yeast, by
              constructing a large-scale library of mutants that differ only in
              the 10 bp preceding the translational start site of a fluorescent
              reporter. Using a high-throughput sequencing strategy, we
              obtained highly accurate measurements of protein abundance for
              over 2,000 unique sequence variants. The resulting pool spanned
              an approximately sevenfold range of protein levels, demonstrating
              the powerful consequences of sequence manipulations of even 1-10
              nucleotides immediately upstream of the start codon. We devised
              computational models that predicted over 70\% of the measured

              working links appears in the online documentation. This is a
              major release with several substantial and long-desired new
              features. There are also updates/modifications to the themes and
              color palettes that give better consistency with matplotlib 2.0
              and some notable API changes. New relational plots Three
              completely new plotting functions have been added: catplot,
              scatterplot, and lineplot. The first is a figure-level interface
              to the latter two that combines them with a FacetGrid. The
              functions bring the high-level, dataset-oriented API of the
              seaborn categorical plotting functions to more general plots
              (scatter plots and line plots). These functions can visualize a
              relationship between two numeric variables while mapping up to
              three additional variables by modifying hue, size, and/or style
              semantics. The common high-level API is implemented differently
              in the two functions. For example, the size semantic in
              scatterplot scales the area of scatter plot points, but in
              lineplot it scales width of the line plot lines. The API is
              dataset-oriented, meaning that in both cases you pass the
              variable in your dataset rather than directly specifying the
              matplotlib parameters to use for point area or line width.
              Another way the relational functions differ from existing seaborn
              functionality is that they have better support for using numeric
              variables for hue and size semantics. This functionality may be
              propagated to other functions that can add a hue semantic in
              future versions; it has not been in this release. The lineplot
              function also has support for statistical estimation and is
              replacing the older tsplot function, which still exists but is
              marked for removal in a future release. lineplot is better
              aligned with the API of the rest of the library and more flexible
              in showing relationships across additional variables by modifying
              the size and style semantics independently. It also has
              substantially improved support for date and time data, a major
              pain factor in tsplot. The cost is that some of the more esoteric
              options in tsplot for representing uncertainty (e.g. a
              colormapped KDE of the bootstrap distribution) have not been
              implemented in the new function. There is quite a bit of new
              documentation that explains these new functions in more detail,
              including detailed examples of the various options in the API
              reference and a more verbose tutorial. These functions should be
              considered in a ``stable beta'' state. They have been thoroughly
              tested, but some unknown corner cases may remain to be found. The
              main features are in place, but not all planned functionality has
              been implemented. There are planned improvements to some
              elements, particularly the default legend, that are a little
              rough around the edges in this release. Finally, some of the
              default behavior (e.g. the default range of point/line sizes) may
              change somewhat in future releases. Updates to themes and
              palettes Several changes have been made to the seaborn style
              themes, context scaling, and color palettes. In general the aim
              of these changes was to make the seaborn styles more consistent
              with the style updates in matplotlib 2.0 and to leverage some of
              the new style parameters for better implementation of some
              aspects of the seaborn styles. Here is a list of the changes:
              Reorganized and updated some axes\_style/plotting\_context
              parameters to take advantage of improvements in the matplotlib
              2.0 update. The biggest change involves using several new
              parameterss in the ``style'' spec while moving parameters that
              used to implement the corresponding aesthetics to the ``context''
              spec. For example, axes spines and ticks are now off instead of
              having their width/length zeroed out for the darkgrid style. That
              means the width/length of these elements can now be scaled in
              different contexts. The effect is a more cohesive appearance of
              the plots, especially in larger contexts. These changes include
              only minimal support for the 1.x matplotlib series. Users who are
              stuck on matplotlib 1.5 but wish to use seaborn styling may want
              to use the seaborn parameters that can be accessed through the
              matplotlib stylesheet interface. Updated the seaborn palettes
              (``deep'', ``muted'', ``colorblind'', etc.) to correspond with
              the new 10-color matplotlib default. The legacy palettes are now
              available at ``deep6'', ``muted6'', ``colorblind6'', etc.
              Additionally, a few individual colors were tweaked for better
              consistency, aesthetics, and accessibility. Calling
              color\_palette (or set\_palette) with a named qualitative
              palettes (i.e. one of the seaborn palettes, the colorbrewer
              qualitative palettes, or the matplotlib matplotlib
              tableau-derived palettes) and no specified number of colors will
              return all of the colors in the palette. This means that for some
              palettes, the returned list will have a different length than it
              did in previous versions. Enhanced color\_palette to accept a
              parameterized specification of a cubehelix palette in in a
              string, prefixed with ``ch:'' (e.g. ``ch:-.1,.2,l=.7''). Note
              that keyword arguments can be spelled out or referenced using
              only their first letter. Reversing the palette is accomplished by
              appending ``\_r'', as with other matplotlib colormaps. This
              specification will be accepted by any seaborn function with a
              palette= parameter. Slightly increased the base font sizes in
              plotting\_context and increased the scaling factors for ``talk''
              and ``poster'' contexts. Calling set will now call
              set\_color\_codes to re-assign the single letter color codes by
              default API changes A few functions have been renamed or have had
              changes to their default parameters. The factorplot function has
              been renamed to catplot. The new name ditches the original
              R-inflected terminology to use a name that is more consistent
              with terminology in pandas and in seaborn itself. This change
              should hopefully make catplot easier to discover, and it should
              make more clear what its role is. factorplot still exists and
              will pass its arguments through to catplot with a warning. It may
              be removed eventually, but the transition will be as gradual as
              possible. The other reason that the factorplot name was changed
              was to ease another alteration which is that the default kind in
              catplot is now ``strip'' (corresponding to stripplot). This plots
              a categorical scatter plot which is usually a much better place
              to start and is more consistent with the default in relplot. The
              old default style in factorplot (``point'', corresponding to
              pointplot) remains available if you want to show a statistical
              estimation. The lvplot function has been renamed to boxenplot.
              The ``letter-value'' terminology that was used to name the
              original kind of plot is obscure, and the abbreviation to lv did
              not help anything. The new name should make the plot more
              discoverable by describing its format (it plots multiple boxes,
              also known as ``boxen''). As with factorplot, the lvplot function
              still exists to provide a relatively smooth transition. Renamed
              the size parameter to height in multi-plot grid objects
              (FacetGrid, PairGrid, and JointGrid) along with functions that
              use them (factorplot, lmplot, pairplot, and jointplot) to avoid
              conflicts with the size parameter that is used in scatterplot and
              lineplot (necessary to make relplot work) and also makes the
              meaning of the parameter a bit more clear. Changed the default
              diagonal plots in pairplot to use `func`:kdeplot` when a ``hue''
              dimension is used. Deprecated the statistical annotation
              component of JointGrid. The method is still available but will be
              removed in a future version. Two older functions that were
              deprecated in earlier versions, coefplot and interactplot, have
              undergone final removal from the code base. Documentation
              improvements There has been some effort put into improving the
              documentation. The biggest change is that the introduction to the
              library has been completely rewritten to provide much more
              information and, critically, examples. In addition to the
              high-level motivation, the introduction also covers some
              important topics that are often sources of confusion, like the
              distinction between figure-level and axes-level functions, how
              datasets should be formatted for use in seaborn, and how to
              customize the appearance of the plots. Other improvements have
              been made throughout, most notably a thorough re-write of the
              categorical tutorial categorical\_tutorial. Other small
              enhancements and bug fixes Changed rugplot to plot a matplotlib
              LineCollection instead of many Line2D objects, providing a big
              speedup for large arrays. Changed the default off-diagonal plots
              to use scatterplot. (Note that the ``hue'' currently draws three
              separate scatterplots instead of using the hue semantic of the
              scatterplot function). Changed color handling when using kdeplot
              with two variables. The default colormap for the 2D density now
              follows the color cycle, and the function can use color and label
              kwargs, adding more flexibility and avoiding a warning when using
              with multi-plot grids. Added the subplot\_kws parameter to
              PairGrid for more flexibility. Removed a special case in PairGrid
              that defaulted to drawing stacked histograms on the diagonal
              axes. Fixed jointplot/JointGrid and regplot so that they now
              accept list inputs. Fixed a bug in FacetGrid when using a single
              row/column level or using col\_wrap=1. Fixed functions that set
              axis limits so that they preserve auto-scaling state on
              matplotlib 2.0. Avoided an error when using matplotlib backends
              that cannot render a canvas (e.g. PDF). Changed the install
              infrastructure to explicitly declare dependencies in a way that
              pip is aware of. This means that pip install seaborn will now
              work in an empty environment. Additionally, the dependencies are
              specified with strict minimal versions. Updated the testing
              infrastructure to execute tests with pytest (although many
              individual tests still use nose assertion).",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: A large class of RNA secondary structure prediction
              programs uses an elaborate energy model grounded in extensive
              thermodynamic measurements and exact dynamic programming
              algorithms. External experimental evidence can be in principle be
              incorporated by means of hard constraints that restrict the
              search space or by means of soft constraints that distort the
              energy model. In particular recent advances in coupling chemical
              and enzymatic probing with sequencing techniques but also
              comparative approaches provide an increasing amount of
              experimental data to be combined with secondary structure
              prediction. RESULTS: Responding to the increasing needs for a
              versatile and user-friendly inclusion of external evidence into
              diverse flavors of RNA secondary structure prediction tools we
              implemented a generic layer of constraint handling into the
              ViennaRNA Package. It makes explicit use of the conceptual
              separation of the ``folding grammar'' defining the search space
              and the actual energy evaluation, which allows constraints to be
              interleaved in a natural way between recursion steps and
              evaluation of the standard energy function. CONCLUSIONS: The
              extension of the ViennaRNA Package provides a generic way to
              include diverse types of constraints into RNA folding algorithms.
              The computational overhead incurred is negligible in practice. A
              wide variety of application scenarios can be accommodated by the

              shown to explain N-terminal codon bias in prokaryotic genomes.
              Using a systematic study of synonymous substitutions in two
              endogenous E. coli genes, we show that interactions between the
              coding region and the upstream Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence
              modulate the efficiency of translation initiation, affecting both
              intracellular mRNA and protein levels due to the inherent
              coupling of transcription and translation in E. coli. We further
              demonstrate that far-downstream mutations can also modulate mRNA
              levels by occluding the SD sequence through the formation of
              non-equilibrium secondary structures. By contrast, a
              non-endogenous RNA polymerase that decouples transcription and
              translation largely alleviates the effects of synonymous
              substitutions on mRNA levels. Finally, a complementary
              statistical analysis of the E. coli genome specifically
              implicates avoidance of intra-molecular base pairing with the SD
              sequence. Our results provide general physical insights into the

              crucial in emergency and critical care medicine. Estimating the
              95\% confidence interval (CI) of the likelihood ratio (LR) can be
              challenging when sample sensitivity is 100\%. We aimed to
              develop, compare, and automate a bootstrapping method to estimate
              the negative LR CI when sample sensitivity is 100\%. Methods The
              lowest population sensitivity that is most likely to yield sample
              sensitivity 100\% is located using the binomial distribution.
              Random binomial samples generated using this population
              sensitivity are then used in the LR bootstrap. A free R program,
              ``bootLR,'' automates the process. Extensive simulations were
              performed to determine how often the LR bootstrap and comparator
              method 95\% CIs cover the true population negative LR value.
              Finally, the 95\% CI was compared for theoretical sample sizes
              and sensitivities approaching and including 100\% using: (1) a
              technique of individual extremes, (2) SAS software based on the
              technique of Gart and Nam, (3) the Score CI (as implemented in
              the StatXact, SAS, and R PropCI package), and (4) the
              bootstrapping technique. Results The bootstrapping approach
              demonstrates appropriate coverage of the nominal 95\% CI over a
              spectrum of populations and sample sizes. Considering a study of
              sample size 200 with 100 patients with disease, and specificity
              60\%, the lowest population sensitivity with median sample
              sensitivity 100\% is 99.31\%. When all 100 patients with disease
              test positive, the negative LR 95\% CIs are: individual extremes
              technique (0,0.073), StatXact (0,0.064), SAS Score method
              (0,0.057), R PropCI (0,0.062), and bootstrap (0,0.048). Similar
              trends were observed for other sample sizes. Conclusions When
              study samples demonstrate 100\% sensitivity, available methods
              may yield inappropriately wide negative LR CIs. An alternative
              bootstrapping approach and accompanying free open-source R

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Production of proteins as therapeutic agents,
              research reagents and molecular tools frequently depends on
              expression in heterologous hosts. Synthetic genes are
              increasingly used for protein production because sequence
              information is easier to obtain than the corresponding physical
              DNA. Protein-coding sequences are commonly re-designed to enhance
              expression, but there are no experimentally supported design
              principles. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To identify sequence features
              that affect protein expression we synthesized and expressed in E.
              coli two sets of 40 genes encoding two commercially valuable
              proteins, a DNA polymerase and a single chain antibody. Genes
              differing only in synonymous codon usage expressed protein at
              levels ranging from undetectable to 30\% of cellular protein.
              Using partial least squares regression we tested the correlation
              of protein production levels with parameters that have been
              reported to affect expression. We found that the amount of
              protein produced in E. coli was strongly dependent on the codons
              used to encode a subset of amino acids. Favorable codons were
              predominantly those read by tRNAs that are most highly charged
              during amino acid starvation, not codons that are most abundant
              in highly expressed E. coli proteins. Finally we confirmed the
              validity of our models by designing, synthesizing and testing new
              genes using codon biases predicted to perform well. CONCLUSION:
              The systematic analysis of gene design parameters shown in this
              study has allowed us to identify codon usage within a gene as a
              critical determinant of achievable protein expression levels in
              E. coli. We propose a biochemical basis for this, as well as
              design algorithms to ensure high protein production from
              synthetic genes. Replication of this methodology should allow
              similar design algorithms to be empirically derived for any

              to solving this problem, but has been heavily biased toward the
              study of the effect of 5' transcript regions and to prokaryotes.
              Here, we employ a synthetic biology driven approach that
              systematically differentiates the effect of different regions of
              the transcript on gene expression up to 240 nucleotides into the
              ORF. This enabled us to discover new causal effects between
              features in previously unexplored regions of transcripts, and
              gene expression in natural regimes. We rationally designed,
              constructed, and analyzed 383 gene variants of the viral HRSVgp04
              gene ORF, with multiple synonymous mutations at key positions
              along the transcript in the eukaryote S. cerevisiae. Our results
              show that a few silent mutations at the 5'UTR can have a dramatic
              effect of up to 15 fold change on protein levels, and that even
              synonymous mutations in positions more than 120 nucleotides
              downstream from the ORF 5'end can modulate protein levels up to
              160\%-300\%. We demonstrate that the correlation between protein
              levels and folding energy increases with the significance of the
              level of selection of the latter in endogenous genes, reinforcing
              the notion that selection for folding strength in different parts
              of the ORF is related to translation regulation. Our measured
              protein abundance correlates notably(correlation up to r = 0.62
              (p=0.0013)) with mean relative codon decoding times, based on

              the conjecture that translation elongation and adaptation to the
              tRNA pool can modify protein levels in a causal/direct manner.

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The construction of customized nucleic acid sequences
              allows us to have greater flexibility in gene design for
              recombinant protein expression. Among the various parameters
              considered for such DNA sequence design, individual codon usage
              (ICU) has been implicated as one of the most crucial factors
              affecting mRNA translational efficiency. However, previous works
              have also reported the significant influence of codon pair usage,
              also known as codon context (CC), on the level of protein
              expression. RESULTS: In this study, we have developed novel
              computational procedures for evaluating the relative importance
              of optimizing ICU and CC for enhancing protein expression. By
              formulating appropriate mathematical expressions to quantify the
              ICU and CC fitness of a coding sequence, optimization procedures
              based on genetic algorithm were employed to maximize its ICU

              genetic code: a code that guides the efficiency of protein

              results from the high-throughput protein-production pipeline of
              the Northeast Structural Genomics Consortium. Proteins expressed
              in E. coli and consistently purified were scored independently

              logistic regressions to determine whether they are systematically
              influenced by fractional amino acid composition or several bulk
              sequence parameters including hydrophobicity, sidechain entropy,
              electrostatic charge, and predicted backbone disorder. Decreasing
              hydrophobicity correlates with higher expression and solubility
              levels, but this correlation apparently derives solely from the
              beneficial effect of three charged amino acids, at least for
              bacterial proteins. In fact, the three most hydrophobic residues
              showed very different correlations with solubility level. Leu
              showed the strongest negative correlation among amino acids,
              while Ile showed a slightly positive correlation in most data
              segments. Several other amino acids also had unexpected effects.
              Notably, Arg correlated with decreased expression and, most
              surprisingly, solubility of bacterial proteins, an effect only
              partially attributable to rare codons. However, rare codons did
              significantly reduce expression despite use of a codon-enhanced

              with their random expectations. This effect is over and above
              that contributed by nonrandomness in the use of amino acid pairs,
              which itself is highly evident; it is much weaker when
              nonadjacent codon pairs are examined and virtually disappears
              when pairs separated by two or three intervening codons are

              this bias: any codon that participates in many nonrandom pairs

              sequences are important in various DNA sequencing applications

              RESULTS: This paper describes a new algorithm for finding a
              consensus sequence, using the popular optimization method known
              as simulated annealing. Unlike the conventional approach of
              finding a consensus sequence by first forming a multiple sequence
              alignment, this algorithm searches for a sequence that minimises
              the sum of pairwise distances to each of the input sequences. The
              resulting consensus sequence can then be used to induce a
              multiple sequence alignment. The time required by the algorithm

              quadratically with the length of the consensus sequence. We

              Similarly, the accessibility of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence is
              essential for translation to start in prokaryotes. Furthermore,
              many classes of RNA binding proteins require the binding site to

              accessibility of all intervals within an RNA sequence in (n3)
              time. This improves on previous implementations where only

              the growth medium. Recombinant expression in E. coli influences
              the cell physiology and triggers a stress response, which has to
              be considered in process development. Increased expression of a
              functional protein can be achieved by optimizing the gene,
              plasmid, host cell, and fermentation process. Relevant properties
              of two yeast expression systems, S. cerevisiae and P. pastoris,
              are summarized. Optimization of expression in S. cerevisiae has
              focused mainly on increasing the secretion, which is otherwise
              limiting. P. pastoris was recently approved as a host for
              biopharmaceutical production for the first time. It enables
              high-level protein production and secretion. Additionally,
              genetic engineering has resulted in its ability to produce
              recombinant proteins with humanized glycosylation patterns.
              Several mammalian cell lines of either rodent or human origin are
              also used in biopharmaceutical production. Optimization of their
              expression has focused on clonal selection, interference with
              epigenetic factors and genetic engineering. Systemic optimization
              approaches are applied to all cell expression systems. They
              feature parallel high-throughput techniques, such as DNA
              microarray, next-generation sequencing and proteomics, and enable
              simultaneous monitoring of multiple parameters. Systemic
              approaches, together with technological advances such as
              disposable bioreactors and microbioreactors, are expected to lead
              to increased quality and quantity of biopharmaceuticals, as well
              as to reduced product development times.",

              two-dimensional (2-D) gel maps of [35S]methionine-labeled
              proteins from noncultured, unfractionated normal human epidermal
              keratinocytes. Forty one proteins, common to most human cell
              types and recorded in the human keratinocyte 2-D gel protein
              database were identified in the 2-D gel maps and their
              isoelectric points (pI) were determined using narrow-range IPGs.
              The latter established a pH scale that allowed comparisons
              between 2-D gel maps generated either with other IPGs in the
              first dimension or with different human protein samples. Of the
              41 proteins identified, a subset of 18 was defined as suitable to
              evaluate the correlation between calculated and experimental pI
              values for polypeptides with known composition. The variance
              calculated for the discrepancies between calculated and
              experimental pI values for these proteins was 0.001 pH units.
              Comparison of the values by the t-test for dependent samples
              (paired test) gave a p-level of 0.49, indicating that there is no
              significant difference between the calculated and experimental pI
              values. The precision of the calculated values depended on the
              buffer capacity of the proteins, and on average, it improved with
              increased buffer capacity. As shown here, the widely available
              information on protein sequences cannot, a priori, be assumed to
              be sufficient for calculating pI values because
              post-translational modifications, in particular N-terminal
              blockage, pose a major problem. Of the 36 proteins analyzed in
              this study, 18-20 were found to be N-terminally blocked and of
              these only 6 were indicated as such in databases. The probability
              of N-terminal blockage depended on the nature of the N-terminal
              group. Twenty six of the proteins had either M, S or A as
              N-terminal amino acids and of these 17-19 were blocked. Only 1 in

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Recombinant protein production is a useful
              biotechnology to produce a large quantity of highly soluble
              proteins. Currently, the most widely used production system is to
              fuse a target protein into different vectors in Escherichia coli
              (E. coli). However, the production efficacy of different vectors
              varies for different target proteins. Trial-and-error is still
              the common practice to find out the efficacy of a vector for a
              given target protein. Previous studies are limited in that they
              assumed that proteins would be over-expressed and focused only on
              the solubility of expressed proteins. In fact, many pairings of
              vectors and proteins result in no expression. RESULTS: In this
              study, we applied machine learning to train prediction models to
              predict whether a pairing of vector-protein will express or not
              express in E. coli. For expressed cases, the models further
              predict whether the expressed proteins would be soluble. We
              collected a set of real cases from the clients of our recombinant
              protein production core facility, where six different vectors
              were designed and studied. This set of cases is used in both
              training and evaluation of our models. We evaluate three
              different models based on the support vector machines (SVM) and
              their ensembles. Unlike many previous works, these models
              consider the sequence of the target protein as well as the
              sequence of the whole fusion vector as the features. We show that
              a model that classifies a case into one of the three classes (no
              expression, inclusion body and soluble) outperforms a model that
              considers the nested structure of the three classes, while a
              model that can take advantage of the hierarchical structure of
              the three classes performs slight worse but comparably to the
              best model. Meanwhile, compared to previous works, we show that
              the prediction accuracy of our best method still performs the
              best. Lastly, we briefly present two methods to use the trained
              model in the design of the recombinant protein production systems
              to improve the chance of high soluble protein production.
              CONCLUSION: In this paper, we show that a machine learning
              approach to the prediction of the efficacy of a vector for a
              target protein in a recombinant protein production system is
              promising and may compliment traditional knowledge-driven study
              of the efficacy. We will release our program to share with other
              labs in the public domain when this paper is published.",

              Atomic displacement parameters, or B-factors, from X-ray
              crystallographic studies give an experimentally determined
              indication of the degree of mobility in a protein structure. To
              provide better estimators of amino acid flexibility, we have
              examined B-factors from a large set of high-resolution crystal
              structures. Because of the differences among structures, it is
              necessary to normalize the B-factors. However, many proteins have
              segments of unusually high mobility, which must be accounted for
              before normalization can be performed. Accordingly, a

              pharmaceutical research and production yield. For a given
              protein, the extent of its solubility can represent the quality
              of its function, and is ultimately defined by its sequence. Thus,
              it is imperative to develop novel, highly accurate in silico
              sequence-based protein solubility predictors. In this work we
              propose, DeepSol, a novel Deep Learning-based protein solubility
              predictor. The backbone of our framework is a convolutional
              neural network that exploits k-mer structure and additional
              sequence and structural features extracted from the protein
              sequence. Results: DeepSol outperformed all known sequence-based
              state-of-the-art solubility prediction methods and attained an
              accuracy of 0.77 and Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.55.

  abstract = "This is a major release from 0.4. Highlights include new
              functions for plotting heatmaps, possibly while applying
              clustering algorithms to discover structured relationships. These
              functions are complemented by new custom colormap functions and a
              full set of IPython widgets that allow interactive selection of
              colormap parameters. The palette tutorial has been rewritten to
              cover these new tools and more generally provide guidance on how
              to use color in visualizations. There are also a number of
              smaller changes and bugfixes. Plotting functions Added the
              heatmap function for visualizing a matrix of data by
              color-encoding the values. See the docs for more information.
              Added the clustermap function for clustering and visualizing a
              matrix of data, with options to label individual rows and columns
              by colors. See the docs for more information. This work was lead
              by Olga Botvinnik. lmplot and pairplot get a new keyword
              argument, markers. This can be a single kind of marker or a list
              of different markers for each level of the hue variable. Using
              different markers for different hues should let plots be more
              comprehensible when reproduced to black-and-white (i.e. when
              printed). See the github pull request for examples. More
              generally, there is a new keyword argument in FacetGrid and
              PairGrid, hue\_kws. This similarly lets plot aesthetics vary
              across the levels of the hue variable, but more flexibily.
              hue\_kws should be a dictionary that maps the name of keyword
              arguments to lists of values that are as long as the number of
              levels of the hue variable. The argument subplot\_kws has been
              added to FacetGrid. This allows for faceted plots with custom
              projections, including maps with Cartopy. Color palettes Added
              two new functions to create custom color palettes. For sequential
              palettes, you can use the light\_palette function, which takes a
              seed color and creates a ramp from a very light, desaturated
              variant of it. For diverging palettes, you can use the
              diverging\_palette function to create a balanced ramp between two
              endpoints to a light or dark midpoint. See the palette tutorial
              for more information. Added the ability to specify the seed color
              for light\_palette and dark\_palette as a tuple of husl or hls
              space values or as a named xkcd color. The interpretation of the
              seed color is now provided by the new input parameter to these
              functions. Added several new interactive palette widgets:
              choose\_colorbrewer\_palette, choose\_light\_palette,
              choose\_dark\_palette, and choose\_diverging\_palette. For
              consistency, renamed the cubehelix widget to
              choose\_cubehelix\_palette (and fixed a bug where the cubehelix
              palette was reversed). These functions also now return either a
              color palette list or a matplotlib colormap when called, and that
              object will be live-updated as you play with the widget. This
              should make it easy to iterate over a plot until you find a good
              representation for the data. See the Github pull request or this
              notebook (download it to use the widgets) for more information.
              Overhauled the color palette tutorial to organize the discussion
              by class of color palette and provide more motivation behind the
              various choices one might make when choosing colors for their
              data. Bug fixes Fixed a bug in PairGrid that gave incorrect
              results (or a crash) when the input DataFrame has a non-default
              index. Fixed a bug in PairGrid where passing columns with a
              date-like datatype raised an exception. Fixed a bug where lmplot
              would show a legend when the hue variable was also used on either
              the rows or columns (making the legend redundant). Worked around
              a matplotlib bug that was forcing outliers in boxplot to appear
              as blue. kdeplot now accepts pandas Series for the data and data2
              arguments. Using a non-default correlation method in corrplot now
              implies sig\_stars=False as the permutation test used to
              significance values for the correlations uses a pearson metric.

              pathological conditions associated with protein deposition, such
              as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, a specific peptide or

              biological processes such as molecular recognition and catalytic
              activity. In silico studies of protein flexibility have attempted
              to characterize and predict flexible regions based on simple
              principles. B-values derived from experimental data are widely
              used to measure residue flexibility. Here, we present the most
              comprehensive large-scale analysis of B-values. We used this
              analysis to develop a neural network-based method that predicts
              flexible-rigid residues from amino acid sequence. The system uses
              both global and local information (i.e., features from the entire
              protein such as secondary structure composition, protein length,
              and fraction of surface residues, and features from a local
              window of sequence-consecutive residues). The most important
              local feature was the evolutionary exchange profile reflecting
              sequence conservation in a family of related proteins. To
              illustrate its potential, we applied our method to 4 different
              case studies, each of which related our predictions to aspects of
              function. The first 2 were the prediction of regions that undergo
              conformational switches upon environmental changes (switch II
              region in Ras) and the prediction of surface regions, the
              rigidity of which is crucial for their function (tunnel in
              propeller folds). Both were correctly captured by our method. The
              third study established that residues in active sites of enzymes
              are predicted by our method to have unexpectedly low B-values.
              The final study demonstrated how well our predictions correlated
              with NMR order parameters to reflect motion. Our method had not
              been set up to address any of the tasks in those 4 case studies.
              Therefore, we expect that this method will assist in many

              disulfide bonds, although certain cytoplasmic enzymes form such
              bonds as part of their catalytic cycles. The disulfide bonds in
              these latter enzymes are reduced in\textit{Escherichia coli}by two
              systems; the thioredoxin pathway and the glutathione/glutaredoxin
              pathway. However, structural disulfide bonds can form in proteins
              in the cytoplasm when the gene (trxB) for the enzyme thioredoxin
              reductase is inactivated by mutation. This disulfide bond
              formation can be detected by assessing the state of the normally
              periplasmic enzyme alkaline phosphatase (AP) when it is localized
              to the cytoplasm. Here we show that the formation of disulfide
              bonds in cytoplasmic AP in the trxB mutant is dependent on the
              presence of two thioredoxins in the cell, thioredoxins 1 and 2,
              the products of the genes trxA and trxC, respectively. Our

              thioredoxins directly catalyze disulfide bond formation in

              show that the recently discovered thioredoxin 2 can perform many
              of the roles of thioredoxin 1 in vivo, and thus is able to reduce

              were derived from 92 refined protein structures in an unbiased

              method of Karplus and Schulz (Naturwissenschaften 72:212-213,

              three-dimensional protein structures to predictions by using
              correlation coefficients. The size of the prediction window was

              ensemble classifiers such as two-stage support vector machine
              (SVM) based classifiers and a number of feature types such as
              physicochemical properties, amino acid and dipeptide composition,
              accompanied with feature selection. It is desirable to develop a
              simple and easily interpretable method for predicting protein
              solubility, compared to existing complex SVM-based methods.
              RESULTS: This study proposes a novel scoring card method (SCM) by
              using dipeptide composition only to estimate solubility scores of
              sequences for predicting protein solubility. SCM calculates the
              propensities of 400 individual dipeptides to be soluble using
              statistic discrimination between soluble and insoluble proteins
              of a training data set. Consequently, the propensity scores of
              all dipeptides are further optimized using an intelligent genetic
              algorithm. The solubility score of a sequence is determined by
              the weighted sum of all propensity scores and dipeptide
              composition. To evaluate SCM by performance comparisons, four
              data sets with different sizes and variation degrees of
              experimental conditions were used. The results show that the
              simple method SCM with interpretable propensities of dipeptides
              has promising performance, compared with existing SVM-based
              ensemble methods with a number of feature types. Furthermore, the
              propensities of dipeptides and solubility scores of sequences can
              provide insights to protein solubility. For example, the analysis
              of dipeptide scores shows high propensity of $\alpha$-helix
              structure and thermophilic proteins to be soluble. CONCLUSIONS:
              The propensities of individual dipeptides to be soluble are
              varied for proteins under altered experimental conditions. For
              accurately predicting protein solubility using SCM, it is better
              to customize the score card of dipeptide propensities by using a
              training data set under the same specified experimental
              conditions. The proposed method SCM with solubility scores and
              dipeptide propensities can be easily applied to the protein

              methods: (i) using a structural alphabet and (ii) combining
              classical X-ray B-factor data and molecular dynamics simulations.
              First, we established a library composed of structural prototypes
              (LSPs) to describe protein structure by a limited set of
              recurring local structures. We developed a prediction method that
              proposes structural candidates in terms of LSPs and predict
              protein flexibility along a given sequence. Second, we examine
              flexibility according to two different descriptors: X-ray
              B-factors considered as good indicators of flexibility and the
              root mean square fluctuations, based on molecular dynamics
              simulations. We then define three flexibility classes and propose
              a method based on the LSP prediction method for predicting
              flexibility along the sequence. This method does not resort to
              sophisticate learning of flexibility but predicts flexibility

              undergo amyloid formation and what driving forces are responsible
              for amyloid-like fiber formation and stabilization remains
              limited. This is mainly because proteins that can undergo
              structural changes, which lead to amyloid formation, are quite
              diverse and share no obvious sequence or structural homology,
              despite the structural similarity found in the fibrils. To
              address these issues, a novel approach based on recursive feature

              identify key features highly correlated with the self-assembly
              problem. This approach allowed the identification of seven

              centered on the cloning, expression and purification of
              6X-His-tagged proteins using T7-based\textit{Escherichia coli}systems.
              The 6X-His tag allows for similar purification procedures for
              most targets and implementation of high-throughput (HTP) parallel
              methods. In most cases, the 6X-His-tagged proteins are
              sufficiently purified (>97\% homogeneity) using a HTP two-step
              purification protocol for most structural studies. Using this
              platform, the open reading frames of over 16,000 different
              targeted proteins (or domains) have been cloned as>26,000

              been purified to homogeneity in tens of milligram quantities (see

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Over the last 20 years in biotechnology, the
              production of recombinant proteins has been a crucial bioprocess
              in both biopharmaceutical and research arena in terms of human
              health, scientific impact and economic volume. Although logical
              strategies of genetic engineering have been established, protein
              overexpression is still an art. In particular, heterologous
              expression is often hindered by low level of production and
              frequent fail due to opaque reasons. The problem is accentuated
              because there is no generic solution available to enhance
              heterologous overexpression. For a given protein, the extent of
              its solubility can indicate the quality of its function. Over
              30\% of synthesized proteins are not soluble. In certain
              experimental circumstances, including temperature, expression
              host, etc., protein solubility is a feature eventually defined by
              its sequence. Until now, numerous methods based on machine
              learning are proposed to predict the solubility of protein merely
              from its amino acid sequence. In spite of the 20 years of
              research on the matter, no comprehensive review is available on
              the published methods. RESULTS: This paper presents an extensive
              review of the existing models to predict protein solubility in
             \textit{Escherichia coli}recombinant protein overexpression system. The
              models are investigated and compared regarding the datasets used,
              features, feature selection methods, machine learning techniques
              and accuracy of prediction. A discussion on the models is
              provided at the end. CONCLUSIONS: This study aims to investigate
              extensively the machine learning based methods to predict
              recombinant protein solubility, so as to offer a general as well
              as a detailed understanding for researches in the field. Some of

              Analyses of protein structures and dynamics are often performed
              with a simplified three-state description, i.e., the classical
              secondary structures. More precise and complete description of
              protein backbone conformation can be obtained using libraries of
              small protein fragments that are able to approximate every part
              of protein structures. These libraries, called structural
              alphabets (SAs), have been widely used in structure analysis

              chromosome-encoded proteins from\textit{Escherichia coli}showed that
              three main factors influence the variability of amino-acid
              composition. The first factor was correlated with the global

              membrane proteins from the others. The second factor was
              correlated with gene expressivity, showing a bias in highly
              expressed genes towards amino-acids having abundant major tRNAs.
              Just as highly expressed genes have reduced codon diversity in
              protein coding sequences, so do they have a reduced diversity of
              amino-acid choice. This showed that translational constraints are
              important enough to affect the global amino-acid composition of
              proteins. The third factor was correlated with the aromaticity of
              proteins, showing that aromatic amino-acid content is highly

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Protein crystal structures are potentially
              over-interpreted since they are routinely refined without any
              restraint on the upper limit of atomic B-factors. Consequently,
              some of their atoms, undetected in the electron density maps, are
              allowed to reach extremely large B-factors, even above 100 square
              Angstroms, and their final positions are purely speculative and
              not based on any experimental evidence. RESULTS: A strategy to
              define B-factors upper limits is described here, based on the
              analysis of protein crystal structures deposited in the Protein
              Data Bank prior 2008, when the tendency to allow B-factor to
              arbitrary inflate was limited. This B-factor upper limit (B\_max)
              is determined by extrapolating the relationship between crystal
              structure average B-factor and percentage of crystal volume
              occupied by solvent (pcVol) to pcVol =100\%, when, ab absurdo,
              the crystal contains only liquid solvent, the structure of which
              is, by definition, undetectable in electron density maps.
              CONCLUSIONS: It is thus possible to highlight structures with
              average B-factors larger than B\_max, which should be considered
              with caution by the users of the information deposited in the

              remains for benchmarking of sequence and structural features with
              experimental data. We study properties in the context of
              experimental solubilities, protein gene expression levels, and
              families of abundant proteins (serum albumin and myoglobin) and
              their less abundant paralogues. A common feature that emerges for

              nonspecific contacts, and thus lysine is favored for proteins at
              relatively high concentration. A survey of protein therapeutics
              shows that a significant subset possesses a relatively low lysine
              to arginine ratio, and therefore may not be favored for high

              The amino acids that were seen to be present in a comparatively

              immobilized pH gradient (IPG) was used to generate
              two-dimensional (2-D) gel maps of [35S]methionine-labeled
              proteins from noncultured, unfractionated normal human epidermal
              keratinocytes. Forty one proteins, common to most human cell
              types and recorded in the human keratinocyte 2-D gel protein
              database were identified in the 2-D gel maps and their
              isoelectric points (pI) were determined using narrow-range IPGs.
              The latter established a pH scale that allowed comparisons
              between 2-D gel maps generated either with other IPGs in the
              first dimension or with different human protein samples. Of the
              41 proteins identified, a subset of 18 was defined as suitable to
              evaluate the correlation between calculated and experimental pI
              values for polypeptides with known composition. The variance
              calculated for the discrepancies between calculated and
              experimental pI values for these proteins was 0.001 pH units.
              Comparison of the values by the t-test for dependent samples
              (paired test) gave a p-level of 0.49, indicating that there is no
              significant difference between the calculated and experimental pI
              values. The precision of the calculated values depended on the
              buffer capacity of the proteins, and on average, it improved with
              increased buffer capacity. As shown here, the widely available
              information on protein sequences cannot, a priori, be assumed to
              be sufficient for calculating pI values because
              post-translational modifications, in particular N-terminal
              blockage, pose a major problem. Of the 36 proteins analyzed in
              this study, 18-20 were found to be N-terminally blocked and of
              these only 6 were indicated as such in databases. The probability
              of N-terminal blockage depended on the nature of the N-terminal
              group. Twenty six of the proteins had either M, S or A as
              N-terminal amino acids and of these 17-19 were blocked. Only 1 in
              10 proteins containing other N-terminal groups were blocked.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Recombinant protein production is a useful
              biotechnology to produce a large quantity of highly soluble
              proteins. Currently, the most widely used production system is to
              fuse a target protein into different vectors in Escherichia coli
              (E. coli). However, the production efficacy of different vectors
              varies for different target proteins. Trial-and-error is still
              the common practice to find out the efficacy of a vector for a
              given target protein. Previous studies are limited in that they
              assumed that proteins would be over-expressed and focused only on
              the solubility of expressed proteins. In fact, many pairings of
              vectors and proteins result in no expression. RESULTS: In this
              study, we applied machine learning to train prediction models to
              predict whether a pairing of vector-protein will express or not
              express in E. coli. For expressed cases, the models further
              predict whether the expressed proteins would be soluble. We
              collected a set of real cases from the clients of our recombinant
              protein production core facility, where six different vectors
              were designed and studied. This set of cases is used in both
              training and evaluation of our models. We evaluate three
              different models based on the support vector machines (SVM) and
              their ensembles. Unlike many previous works, these models
              consider the sequence of the target protein as well as the
              sequence of the whole fusion vector as the features. We show that
              a model that classifies a case into one of the three classes (no
              expression, inclusion body and soluble) outperforms a model that
              considers the nested structure of the three classes, while a
              model that can take advantage of the hierarchical structure of
              the three classes performs slight worse but comparably to the
              best model. Meanwhile, compared to previous works, we show that
              the prediction accuracy of our best method still performs the
              best. Lastly, we briefly present two methods to use the trained
              model in the design of the recombinant protein production systems
              to improve the chance of high soluble protein production.
              CONCLUSION: In this paper, we show that a machine learning
              approach to the prediction of the efficacy of a vector for a
              target protein in a recombinant protein production system is
              promising and may compliment traditional knowledge-driven study
              of the efficacy. We will release our program to share with other
              labs in the public domain when this paper is published.",

              structural features, and a sequence pattern-based method that
              utilizes the occurrence frequencies of sequence patterns. In the
              benchmark test, the proposed methods obtained F-scores of around

              Atomic displacement parameters, or B-factors, from X-ray
              crystallographic studies give an experimentally determined
              indication of the degree of mobility in a protein structure. To
              provide better estimators of amino acid flexibility, we have
              examined B-factors from a large set of high-resolution crystal
              structures. Because of the differences among structures, it is
              necessary to normalize the B-factors. However, many proteins have
              segments of unusually high mobility, which must be accounted for
              before normalization can be performed. Accordingly, a
              median-based method from quality control studies was used to
              identify outliers. After removal of outliers from, and
              normalization of, each protein chain, the B-factors were
              collected for each amino acid in the set. It was found that the
              distribution of normalized B-factors followed a Gumbel, or
              extreme value distribution, and the location parameter, or mode,

  abstract = "Motivation: Protein solubility plays a vital role in
              pharmaceutical research and production yield. For a given
              protein, the extent of its solubility can represent the quality
              of its function, and is ultimately defined by its sequence. Thus,
              it is imperative to develop novel, highly accurate in silico
              sequence-based protein solubility predictors. In this work we
              propose, DeepSol, a novel Deep Learning-based protein solubility
              predictor. The backbone of our framework is a convolutional
              neural network that exploits k-mer structure and additional
              sequence and structural features extracted from the protein
              sequence. Results: DeepSol outperformed all known sequence-based
              state-of-the-art solubility prediction methods and attained an
              accuracy of 0.77 and Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.55.
              The superior prediction accuracy of DeepSol allows to screen for

              predict solubility of novel proteins. Availability and

  abstract = "This is a major release from 0.4. Highlights include new
              functions for plotting heatmaps, possibly while applying
              clustering algorithms to discover structured relationships. These
              functions are complemented by new custom colormap functions and a
              full set of IPython widgets that allow interactive selection of
              colormap parameters. The palette tutorial has been rewritten to
              cover these new tools and more generally provide guidance on how
              to use color in visualizations. There are also a number of
              smaller changes and bugfixes. Plotting functions Added the
              heatmap function for visualizing a matrix of data by
              color-encoding the values. See the docs for more information.
              Added the clustermap function for clustering and visualizing a
              matrix of data, with options to label individual rows and columns
              by colors. See the docs for more information. This work was lead
              by Olga Botvinnik. lmplot and pairplot get a new keyword
              argument, markers. This can be a single kind of marker or a list
              of different markers for each level of the hue variable. Using
              different markers for different hues should let plots be more
              comprehensible when reproduced to black-and-white (i.e. when
              printed). See the github pull request for examples. More
              generally, there is a new keyword argument in FacetGrid and
              PairGrid, hue\_kws. This similarly lets plot aesthetics vary
              across the levels of the hue variable, but more flexibily.
              hue\_kws should be a dictionary that maps the name of keyword
              arguments to lists of values that are as long as the number of
              levels of the hue variable. The argument subplot\_kws has been
              added to FacetGrid. This allows for faceted plots with custom
              projections, including maps with Cartopy. Color palettes Added
              two new functions to create custom color palettes. For sequential
              palettes, you can use the light\_palette function, which takes a
              seed color and creates a ramp from a very light, desaturated
              variant of it. For diverging palettes, you can use the
              diverging\_palette function to create a balanced ramp between two
              endpoints to a light or dark midpoint. See the palette tutorial
              for more information. Added the ability to specify the seed color
              for light\_palette and dark\_palette as a tuple of husl or hls
              space values or as a named xkcd color. The interpretation of the
              seed color is now provided by the new input parameter to these
              functions. Added several new interactive palette widgets:
              choose\_colorbrewer\_palette, choose\_light\_palette,
              choose\_dark\_palette, and choose\_diverging\_palette. For
              consistency, renamed the cubehelix widget to
              choose\_cubehelix\_palette (and fixed a bug where the cubehelix
              palette was reversed). These functions also now return either a
              color palette list or a matplotlib colormap when called, and that
              object will be live-updated as you play with the widget. This
              should make it easy to iterate over a plot until you find a good
              representation for the data. See the Github pull request or this
              notebook (download it to use the widgets) for more information.
              Overhauled the color palette tutorial to organize the discussion
              by class of color palette and provide more motivation behind the
              various choices one might make when choosing colors for their
              data. Bug fixes Fixed a bug in PairGrid that gave incorrect
              results (or a crash) when the input DataFrame has a non-default
              index. Fixed a bug in PairGrid where passing columns with a
              date-like datatype raised an exception. Fixed a bug where lmplot
              would show a legend when the hue variable was also used on either
              the rows or columns (making the legend redundant). Worked around
              a matplotlib bug that was forcing outliers in boxplot to appear
              as blue. kdeplot now accepts pandas Series for the data and data2
              arguments. Using a non-default correlation method in corrplot now
              implies sig\_stars=False as the permutation test used to
              significance values for the correlations uses a pearson metric.

  abstract = "Structural flexibility has been associated with various
              biological processes such as molecular recognition and catalytic
              activity. In silico studies of protein flexibility have attempted
              to characterize and predict flexible regions based on simple
              principles. B-values derived from experimental data are widely
              used to measure residue flexibility. Here, we present the most
              comprehensive large-scale analysis of B-values. We used this
              analysis to develop a neural network-based method that predicts
              flexible-rigid residues from amino acid sequence. The system uses
              both global and local information (i.e., features from the entire
              protein such as secondary structure composition, protein length,
              and fraction of surface residues, and features from a local
              window of sequence-consecutive residues). The most important
              local feature was the evolutionary exchange profile reflecting
              sequence conservation in a family of related proteins. To
              illustrate its potential, we applied our method to 4 different
              case studies, each of which related our predictions to aspects of
              function. The first 2 were the prediction of regions that undergo
              conformational switches upon environmental changes (switch II
              region in Ras) and the prediction of surface regions, the
              rigidity of which is crucial for their function (tunnel in
              propeller folds). Both were correctly captured by our method. The
              third study established that residues in active sites of enzymes
              are predicted by our method to have unexpectedly low B-values.
              The final study demonstrated how well our predictions correlated
              with NMR order parameters to reflect motion. Our method had not
              been set up to address any of the tasks in those 4 case studies.
              Therefore, we expect that this method will assist in many
              attempts at inferring aspects of function.",

              these latter enzymes are reduced in Escherichia coli by two
              systems; the thioredoxin pathway and the glutathione/glutaredoxin
              pathway. However, structural disulfide bonds can form in proteins
              in the cytoplasm when the gene (trxB) for the enzyme thioredoxin
              reductase is inactivated by mutation. This disulfide bond
              formation can be detected by assessing the state of the normally
              periplasmic enzyme alkaline phosphatase (AP) when it is localized
              to the cytoplasm. Here we show that the formation of disulfide
              bonds in cytoplasmic AP in the trxB mutant is dependent on the
              presence of two thioredoxins in the cell, thioredoxins 1 and 2,
              the products of the genes trxA and trxC, respectively. Our

              thioredoxins directly catalyze disulfide bond formation in

              show that the recently discovered thioredoxin 2 can perform many
              of the roles of thioredoxin 1 in vivo, and thus is able to reduce

              were derived from 92 refined protein structures in an unbiased
              selection of the Protein Data Bank by developing further the
              method of Karplus and Schulz (Naturwissenschaften 72:212-213,

              three-dimensional protein structures to predictions by using
              correlation coefficients. The size of the prediction window was

              overexpression in Escherichia coli advance performance by using
              ensemble classifiers such as two-stage support vector machine
              (SVM) based classifiers and a number of feature types such as
              physicochemical properties, amino acid and dipeptide composition,
              accompanied with feature selection. It is desirable to develop a
              simple and easily interpretable method for predicting protein
              solubility, compared to existing complex SVM-based methods.
              RESULTS: This study proposes a novel scoring card method (SCM) by
              using dipeptide composition only to estimate solubility scores of
              sequences for predicting protein solubility. SCM calculates the
              propensities of 400 individual dipeptides to be soluble using
              statistic discrimination between soluble and insoluble proteins
              of a training data set. Consequently, the propensity scores of
              all dipeptides are further optimized using an intelligent genetic
              algorithm. The solubility score of a sequence is determined by
              the weighted sum of all propensity scores and dipeptide
              composition. To evaluate SCM by performance comparisons, four
              data sets with different sizes and variation degrees of
              experimental conditions were used. The results show that the
              simple method SCM with interpretable propensities of dipeptides
              has promising performance, compared with existing SVM-based
              ensemble methods with a number of feature types. Furthermore, the
              propensities of dipeptides and solubility scores of sequences can
              provide insights to protein solubility. For example, the analysis
              of dipeptide scores shows high propensity of $\alpha$-helix
              structure and thermophilic proteins to be soluble. CONCLUSIONS:
              The propensities of individual dipeptides to be soluble are
              varied for proteins under altered experimental conditions. For
              accurately predicting protein solubility using SCM, it is better
              to customize the score card of dipeptide propensities by using a
              training data set under the same specified experimental
              conditions. The proposed method SCM with solubility scores and
              dipeptide propensities can be easily applied to the protein

              function at a molecular level. Dynamics and flexibility of
              protein structures are also key elements of protein function. So,
              we have proposed to look at protein flexibility using novel
              methods: (i) using a structural alphabet and (ii) combining
              classical X-ray B-factor data and molecular dynamics simulations.
              First, we established a library composed of structural prototypes
              (LSPs) to describe protein structure by a limited set of
              recurring local structures. We developed a prediction method that
              proposes structural candidates in terms of LSPs and predict
              protein flexibility along a given sequence. Second, we examine
              flexibility according to two different descriptors: X-ray
              B-factors considered as good indicators of flexibility and the
              root mean square fluctuations, based on molecular dynamics
              simulations. We then define three flexibility classes and propose
              a method based on the LSP prediction method for predicting
              flexibility along the sequence. This method does not resort to
              sophisticate learning of flexibility but predicts flexibility
              from average flexibility of predicted local structures. The
              method is implemented in PredyFlexy web server. Results are

              experimentally observed in protein X-ray crystallography.
              Previous theoretical models have made strong inroads in the
              analysis of beta (B)-factors by linearly fitting protein
              B-factors from experimental data. However, the blind prediction
              of B-factors for unknown proteins is an unsolved problem. This
              work integrates machine learning and advanced graph theory,
              namely, multiscale weighted colored graphs (MWCGs), to blindly
              predict B-factors of unknown proteins. MWCGs are local features
              that measure the intrinsic flexibility due to a protein
              structure. Global features that connect the B-factors of
              different proteins, e.g., the resolution of X-ray
              crystallography, are introduced to enable the cross-protein
              B-factor predictions. Several machine learning approaches,
              including ensemble methods and deep learning, are considered in
              the present work. The proposed method is validated with hundreds
              of thousands of experimental B-factors. Extensive numerical
              results indicate that the blind B-factor predictions obtained
              from the present method are more accurate than the least squares

              can be helpful for the further study of the protein function. In
              this study, we attempted to correlate the flexibility of a

              feature such interactions. A prediction model was constructed for
              B-factor of a residue by using support vector regression (SVR).
              Pearson correlation coefficient (CC) was used as the performance
              measure. CC values were 0.63 and 0.62 for single amino acid and

              The 6X-His tag allows for similar purification procedures for

              production of recombinant proteins has been a crucial bioprocess
              in both biopharmaceutical and research arena in terms of human
              health, scientific impact and economic volume. Although logical
              strategies of genetic engineering have been established, protein
              overexpression is still an art. In particular, heterologous
              expression is often hindered by low level of production and
              frequent fail due to opaque reasons. The problem is accentuated
              because there is no generic solution available to enhance
              heterologous overexpression. For a given protein, the extent of
              its solubility can indicate the quality of its function. Over
              30\% of synthesized proteins are not soluble. In certain
              experimental circumstances, including temperature, expression
              host, etc., protein solubility is a feature eventually defined by
              its sequence. Until now, numerous methods based on machine
              learning are proposed to predict the solubility of protein merely
              from its amino acid sequence. In spite of the 20 years of
              research on the matter, no comprehensive review is available on
              the published methods. RESULTS: This paper presents an extensive
              review of the existing models to predict protein solubility in
              Escherichia coli recombinant protein overexpression system. The
              models are investigated and compared regarding the datasets used,

              extensively the machine learning based methods to predict
              recombinant protein solubility, so as to offer a general as well
              as a detailed understanding for researches in the field. Some of

              over-interpreted since they are routinely refined without any
              restraint on the upper limit of atomic B-factors. Consequently,
              some of their atoms, undetected in the electron density maps, are
              allowed to reach extremely large B-factors, even above 100 square
              Angstroms, and their final positions are purely speculative and
              not based on any experimental evidence. RESULTS: A strategy to
              define B-factors upper limits is described here, based on the
              analysis of protein crystal structures deposited in the Protein
              Data Bank prior 2008, when the tendency to allow B-factor to
              arbitrary inflate was limited. This B-factor upper limit (B\_max)
              is determined by extrapolating the relationship between crystal
              structure average B-factor and percentage of crystal volume
              occupied by solvent (pcVol) to pcVol =100\%, when, ab absurdo,
              the crystal contains only liquid solvent, the structure of which
              is, by definition, undetectable in electron density maps.
              CONCLUSIONS: It is thus possible to highlight structures with
              average B-factors larger than B\_max, which should be considered
              with caution by the users of the information deposited in the

              remains for benchmarking of sequence and structural features with
              experimental data. We study properties in the context of
              experimental solubilities, protein gene expression levels, and
              families of abundant proteins (serum albumin and myoglobin) and
              their less abundant paralogues. A common feature that emerges for

              shows that a significant subset possesses a relatively low lysine
              to arginine ratio, and therefore may not be favored for high

              The amino acids that were seen to be present in a comparatively

              sheet propensity, whereas those that are seen more in soluble

              which in most cases irreversibly impairs protein function, as
              exemplified by the formation of inclusion bodies. Although it has
              been empirically determined that some proteins tend to aggregate,
              the relationship between the protein aggregation propensities and
              the primary sequences remains poorly understood. Here, we
              individually synthesized the entire ensemble of Escherichia coli

              evaluate the inherent aggregation propensities of thousands of
              proteins in a translation-coupled manner. A histogram of the
              solubilities, based on data from 3,173 translated proteins,
              revealed a clear bimodal distribution, indicating that the
              aggregation propensities are not evenly distributed across a

              groups, soluble and aggregation-prone proteins. The aggregation
              propensity is most prominently correlated with the structural
              classification of proteins, implying that the prediction of

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: The solubility of a protein is often decisive for its
              proper functioning. Lack of solubility is a major bottleneck in
              high-throughput structural genomic studies and in
              high-concentration protein production, and the formation of
              protein aggregates causes a wide variety of diseases. Since
              solubility measurements are time-consuming and expensive, there
              is a strong need for solubility prediction tools. RESULTS: We
              have recently introduced solubility-dependent distance potentials
              that are able to unravel the role of residue-residue interactions
              in promoting or decreasing protein solubility. Here, we extended
              their construction by defining solubility-dependent potentials
              based on backbone torsion angles and solvent accessibility, and
              integrated them, together with other structure- and
              sequence-based features, into a random forest model trained on a
              set of E. coli proteins with experimental structures and
              solubility values. We thus obtained the SOLart protein solubility
              predictor, whose most informative features turned out to be
              folding free energy differences computed from our
              solubility-dependent statistical potentials. SOLart performances
              are very good, with a Pearson correlation coefficient between
              experimental and predicted solubility values of almost 0.7 both
              in cross validation on the training dataset and in an independent
              set of S. Cerevisiae proteins. On test sets of modeled
              structures, only a limited drop in performance is observed.
              SOLart can thus be used with both high-resolution and
              low-resolution structures, and clearly outperforms state-of-art
              solubility predictors. It is available through a user-friendly
              webserver, which is easy to use by non-expert scientists.

              minimize aggregate levels in the final product. Aggregation of a
              protein in solution is driven by intrinsic and extrinsic factors.
              In this work we have focused on aggregation as an intrinsic
              property of the molecule. We have studied the sequences and Fab
              structures of commercial and non-commercial antibody sequences
              for their vulnerability towards aggregation by using sequence
              based computational tools to identify potential aggregation-prone
              motifs or regions. The mAbs in our dataset contain 2 to 8
              aggregation-prone motifs per heavy and light chain pair. Some of
              these motifs are located in variable domains, primarily in CDRs.
              Most aggregation-prone motifs are rich in beta branched aliphatic
              and aromatic residues. Hydroxyl-containing Ser/Thr residues are
              also found in several aggregation-prone motifs while charged
              residues are rare. The motifs found in light chain CDR3 are
              glutamine (Q)/asparagine (N) rich. These motifs are similar to
              the reported aggregation promoting regions found in prion and
              amyloidogenic proteins that are also rich in Q/N, aliphatic and
              aromatic residues. The implication is that one possible mechanism
              for aggregation of mAbs may be through formation of cross-beta
              structures and fibrils. Mapping on the available
              Fab-receptor/antigen complex structures reveals that these motifs
              in CDRs might also contribute significantly towards

              both global and local information (i.e., features from the entire
              protein such as secondary structure composition, protein length,
              and fraction of surface residues, and features from a local
              window of sequence-consecutive residues). The most important
              local feature was the evolutionary exchange profile reflecting
              sequence conservation in a family of related proteins. To
              illustrate its potential, we applied our method to 4 different
              case studies, each of which related our predictions to aspects of
              function. The first 2 were the prediction of regions that undergo
              conformational switches upon environmental changes (switch II
              region in Ras) and the prediction of surface regions, the
              rigidity of which is crucial for their function (tunnel in
              propeller folds). Both were correctly captured by our method. The
              third study established that residues in active sites of enzymes
              are predicted by our method to have unexpectedly low B-values.
              The final study demonstrated how well our predictions correlated
              with NMR order parameters to reflect motion. Our method had not
              been set up to address any of the tasks in those 4 case studies.
              Therefore, we expect that this method will assist in many
              attempts at inferring aspects of function.",

              experimentally observed in protein X-ray crystallography.
              Previous theoretical models have made strong inroads in the
              analysis of beta (B)-factors by linearly fitting protein
              B-factors from experimental data. However, the blind prediction
              of B-factors for unknown proteins is an unsolved problem. This
              work integrates machine learning and advanced graph theory,
              namely, multiscale weighted colored graphs (MWCGs), to blindly
              predict B-factors of unknown proteins. MWCGs are local features
              that measure the intrinsic flexibility due to a protein
              structure. Global features that connect the B-factors of
              different proteins, e.g., the resolution of X-ray
              crystallography, are introduced to enable the cross-protein
              B-factor predictions. Several machine learning approaches,
              including ensemble methods and deep learning, are considered in
              the present work. The proposed method is validated with hundreds
              of thousands of experimental B-factors. Extensive numerical
              results indicate that the blind B-factor predictions obtained

               aberrant activation of the innate immune response. Here, we
               identify several mechanisms by which a SARS-CoV open reading
               frame (ORF) activates intracellular stress pathways and targets
               the innate immune response. We show that ORF8b forms insoluble
               intracellular aggregates dependent on a valine at residue 77.
               Aggregated ORF8b induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress,
               lysosomal damage, and subsequent activation of the master
               regulator of the autophagy and lysosome machinery, Transcription
               factor EB (TFEB). ORF8b causes cell death in epithelial cells,
               which is partially rescued by reducing its ability to aggregate.
               In macrophages, ORF8b robustly activates the NLRP3 inflammasome
               by providing a potent signal 2 required for activation.
               Mechanistically, ORF8b interacts directly with the Leucine Rich

              were derived from 92 refined protein structures in an unbiased
              selection of the Protein Data Bank by developing further the
              method of Karplus and Schulz (Naturwissenschaften 72:212-213,

              studied by comparing atomic temperature factors of known
              three-dimensional protein structures to predictions by using
              correlation coefficients. The size of the prediction window was

              over-interpreted since they are routinely refined without any
              restraint on the upper limit of atomic B-factors. Consequently,
              some of their atoms, undetected in the electron density maps, are
              allowed to reach extremely large B-factors, even above 100 square
              Angstroms, and their final positions are purely speculative and
              not based on any experimental evidence. RESULTS: A strategy to
              define B-factors upper limits is described here, based on the
              analysis of protein crystal structures deposited in the Protein
              Data Bank prior 2008, when the tendency to allow B-factor to
              arbitrary inflate was limited. This B-factor upper limit (B\_max)
              is determined by extrapolating the relationship between crystal
              structure average B-factor and percentage of crystal volume
              occupied by solvent (pcVol) to pcVol =100\%, when, ab absurdo,

              routing into one of these alternative protein export systems
              requires the fusion of a Sec- or Tat-specific signal peptide to
              the amino-terminal end of the desired target protein. Since
              signal peptides, besides being required for the targeting to and
              membrane translocation by the respective protein translocases,
              also have additional influences on the biosynthesis, the folding
              kinetics, and the stability of the respective target proteins, it
              is not possible so far to predict in advance which signal peptide
              will perform best in the context of a given target protein and a
              given bacterial expression host. As outlined in this review, the
              most promising way to find the optimal signal peptide for a
              desired protein is to screen the largest possible diversity of
              signal peptides, either generated by signal peptide variation
              using large signal peptide libraries or, alternatively, by
              optimization of a given signal peptide using site-directed or

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Over the past few decades, scientific research has
              been focused on developing peptide/protein-based therapies to
              treat various diseases. With the several advantages over small
              molecules, including high specificity, high penetration, ease of
              manufacturing, peptides have emerged as promising therapeutic
              molecules against many diseases. However, one of the bottlenecks
              in peptide/protein-based therapy is their toxicity. Therefore, in
              the present study, we developed in silico models for predicting
              toxicity of peptides and proteins. DESCRIPTION: We obtained toxic
              peptides having 35 or fewer residues from various databases for
              developing prediction models. Non-toxic or random peptides were
              obtained from SwissProt and TrEMBL. It was observed that certain
              residues like Cys, His, Asn, and Pro are abundant as well as
              preferred at various positions in toxic peptides. We developed
              models based on machine learning technique and quantitative
              matrix using various properties of peptides for predicting
              toxicity of peptides. The performance of dipeptide-based model in
              terms of accuracy was 94.50\% with MCC 0.88. In addition, various
              motifs were extracted from the toxic peptides and this
              information was combined with dipeptide-based model for
              developing a hybrid model. In order to evaluate the
              over-optimization of the best model based on dipeptide
              composition, we evaluated its performance on independent datasets
              and achieved accuracy around 90\%. Based on above study, a web
              server, ToxinPred has been developed, which would be helpful in
              predicting (i) toxicity or non-toxicity of peptides, (ii) minimum
              mutations in peptides for increasing or decreasing their
              toxicity, and (iii) toxic regions in proteins. CONCLUSION:
              ToxinPred is a unique in silico method of its kind, which will be
              useful in predicting toxicity of peptides/proteins. In addition,
              it will be useful in designing least toxic peptides and
              discovering toxic regions in proteins. We hope that the
              development of ToxinPred will provide momentum to
              peptide/protein-based drug discovery
              (http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/toxinpred/).",

              only a quarter of target proteins are soluble and can therefore
              be purified. RESULTS: We have discovered that global structural
              flexibility, which can be modeled by normalized B-factors,
              accurately predicts the solubility of 12 216 recombinant proteins
              expressed in Escherichia coli. We have optimized these B-factors,
              and derived a new set of values for solubility scoring that
              further improves prediction accuracy. We call this new predictor
              the 'Solubility-Weighted Index' (SWI). Importantly, SWI
              outperforms many existing protein solubility prediction tools.
              Furthermore, we have developed 'SoDoPE' (Soluble Domain for

              hydrophobic regions of a transmembrane helix and that of a signal
              peptide, leading to cross-reaction between the two types of
              predictions. To improve predictions further, it is therefore
              important to make a predictor that aims to discriminate between
              the two classes. In addition, topology information can be gained
              when successfully predicting a signal peptide leading a
              transmembrane protein since it dictates that the N terminus of
              the mature protein must be on the non-cytoplasmic side of the
              membrane. Here, we present Phobius, a combined transmembrane
              protein topology and signal peptide predictor. The predictor is
              based on a hidden Markov model (HMM) that models the different
              sequence regions of a signal peptide and the different regions of
              a transmembrane protein in a series of interconnected states.
              Training was done on a newly assembled and curated dataset.
              Compared to TMHMM and SignalP, errors coming from
              cross-prediction between transmembrane segments and signal
              peptides were reduced substantially by Phobius. False
              classifications of signal peptides were reduced from 26.1\% to
              3.9\% and false classifications of transmembrane helices were
              reduced from 19.0\% to 7.7\%. Phobius was applied to the
              proteomes of Homo sapiens and Escherichia coli. Here we also
              noted a drastic reduction of false classifications compared to
              TMHMM/SignalP, suggesting that Phobius is well suited for

  abstract = "Spider neurotoxins are commonly used as pharmacological tools and
              are a popular source of novel compounds with therapeutic and
              agrochemical potential. Since venom peptides are inherently
              toxic, the host spider must employ strategies to avoid adverse
              effects prior to venom use. It is partly for this reason that
              most spider toxins encode a protective proregion that upon
              enzymatic cleavage is excised from the mature peptide. In order
              to identify the mature toxin sequence directly from toxin
              transcripts, without resorting to protein sequencing, the
              propeptide cleavage site in the toxin precursor must be predicted
              bioinformatically. We evaluated different machine learning
              strategies (support vector machines, hidden Markov model and
              decision tree) and developed an algorithm (SpiderP) for
              prediction of propeptide cleavage sites in spider toxins. Our
              strategy uses a support vector machine (SVM) framework that
              combines both local and global sequence information. Our method
              is superior or comparable to current tools for prediction of
              propeptide sequences in spider toxins. Evaluation of the SVM
              method on an independent test set of known toxin sequences
              yielded 96\% sensitivity and 100\% specificity. Furthermore, we
              sequenced five novel peptides (not used to train the final
              predictor) from the venom of the Australian tarantula Selenotypus
              plumipes to test the accuracy of the predictor and found 80\%
              sensitivity and 99.6\% 8-mer specificity. Finally, we used the
              predictor together with homology information to predict and
              characterize seven groups of novel toxins from the deeply

              has its issues: the aggregation of foreign proteins into
              insoluble inclusion bodies is perhaps the main limiting factor of
              the E. coli expression system. Conversely, E. coli benefits of

              engineering novel tailored-made strategies can be designed to
              suit user or process requirements. Gene fusion technology has
              been widely used for the improvement of soluble protein

              A special emphasis is given to the recently discovered Fh8 fusion

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Secondary structure forms an important intermediate
              level of description of nucleic acids that encapsulates the
              dominating part of the folding energy, is often well conserved in
              evolution, and is routinely used as a basis to explain
              experimental findings. Based on carefully measured thermodynamic
              parameters, exact dynamic programming algorithms can be used to
              compute ground states, base pairing probabilities, as well as
              thermodynamic properties. RESULTS: The ViennaRNA Package has been
              a widely used compilation of RNA secondary structure related
              computer programs for nearly two decades. Major changes in the
              structure of the standard energy model, the Turner 2004
              parameters, the pervasive use of multi-core CPUs, and an
              increasing number of algorithmic variants prompted a major
              technical overhaul of both the underlying RNAlib and the
              interactive user programs. New features include an expanded
              repertoire of tools to assess RNA-RNA interactions and restricted
              ensembles of structures, additional output information such as
              centroid structures and maximum expected accuracy structures
              derived from base pairing probabilities, or z-scores for locally
              stable secondary structures, and support for input in fasta
              format. Updates were implemented without compromising the
              computational efficiency of the core algorithms and ensuring
              compatibility with earlier versions. CONCLUSIONS: The ViennaRNA

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Animal toxins operate by binding to receptors and ion
              channels. These proteins are short and vary in sequence,
              structure and function. Sporadic discoveries have also revealed
              endogenous toxin-like proteins in non-venomous organisms. Viral
              proteins are the largest group of quickly evolving proteomes. We
              tested the hypothesis that toxin-like proteins exist in viruses
              and that they act to modulate functions of their hosts. RESULTS:
              We updated and improved a classifier for compact proteins
              resembling short animal toxins that is based on a
              machine-learning method. We applied it in a large-scale setting
              to identify toxin-like proteins among short viral proteins. Among
              the approximately 26 000 representatives of such short proteins,
              510 sequences were positively identified. We focused on the 19
              highest scoring proteins. Among them, we identified
              conotoxin-like proteins, growth factors receptor-like proteins
              and anti-bacterial peptides. Our predictor was shown to enhance
              annotation inference for many 'uncharacterized' proteins. We
              conclude that our protocol can expose toxin-like proteins in
              unexplored niches including metagenomics data and enhance the
              systematic discovery of novel cell modulators for drug

              such as the stonefish, snail, jellyfish, hydra and more.
              Interestingly, proteins that share a common scaffold with animal
              toxins also exist in non-venomous species. However, due to their
              short length and primary sequence diversity, these, toxin-like
              proteins remain undetected by classical search engines and genome
              annotation tools. We construct a toxin classification machine and
              web server called ClanTox (Classifier of Animal Toxins) that is
              based on the extraction of sequence-driven features from the
              primary protein sequence followed by the application of a
              classification system trained on known animal toxins. For a given

  abstract = "RNA secondary structure around translation initiation sites
              strongly affects the abundance of expressed proteins in
              Escherichia coli. However, detailed secondary structural features
              governing protein abundance remain elusive. Recent advances in
              high-throughput DNA synthesis and experimental systems enable us
              to obtain large amounts of data. Here, we evaluated six types of
              structural features using two large-scale datasets. We found that
              accessibility, which is the probability that a given region
              around the start codon has no base-paired nucleotides, showed the
              highest correlation with protein abundance in both datasets.
              Accessibility showed a significantly higher correlation
              (Spearman's $\rho$ = 0.709) than the widely used minimum free
              energy (0.554) in one of the datasets. Interestingly,
              accessibility showed the highest correlation only when it was
              calculated by a log-linear model, indicating that the RNA
              structural model and how to utilize it are important.
              Furthermore, by combining the accessibility and activity of the
              Shine-Dalgarno sequence, we devised a method for predicting
              protein abundance more accurately than existing methods. We
              inferred that the log-linear model has a broader probabilistic
              distribution than the widely used Turner energy model, which

              corresponds to the reduction by a factor of 10 in initiation

              decrease by a factor of 500 in expression because it turned a

              Atomic displacement parameters, or B-factors, from X-ray

              it is imperative to develop novel, highly accurate in silico
              sequence-based protein solubility predictors. In this work we
              propose, DeepSol, a novel Deep Learning-based protein solubility
              predictor. The backbone of our framework is a convolutional
              neural network that exploits k-mer structure and additional

              sequence. Results: DeepSol outperformed all known sequence-based
              state-of-the-art solubility prediction methods and attained an
              accuracy of 0.77 and Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.55.

              overrepresentation or underrepresentation of many pairs compared
              with their random expectations. This effect is over and above
              that contributed by nonrandomness in the use of amino acid pairs,
              which itself is highly evident; it is much weaker when
              nonadjacent codon pairs are examined and virtually disappears
              when pairs separated by two or three intervening codons are
              evaluated. There appears to be a high degree of directionality in
              this bias: any codon that participates in many nonrandom pairs
              tends to make both over- and underrepresented pairs, but
              preferentially as a left- or right-hand member. We show a
              relationship between codon-pair utilization patterns and levels

              levels tend to contain more abundant, but more highly
              underrepresented, codon pairs, relative to genes expressed at low
              levels. The nonrandom utilization of codon pairs may be a

              of miRNA, siRNA or bacterial sRNA to their respective targets.
              Similarly, the accessibility of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence is
              essential for translation to start in prokaryotes. Furthermore,
              many classes of RNA binding proteins require the binding site to
              be single-stranded. RESULTS: We introduce a way to compute the
              accessibility of all intervals within an RNA sequence in (n3)
              time. This improves on previous implementations where only
              intervals of one defined length were computed in the same time.
              While the algorithm is in the same efficiency class as sampling
              approaches, the results, especially if the probabilities get
              small, are much more exact. CONCLUSIONS: Our algorithm

              impact of 5'-UTR sequences on protein levels in yeast, by
              constructing a large-scale library of mutants that differ only in
              the 10 bp preceding the translational start site of a fluorescent
              reporter. Using a high-throughput sequencing strategy, we
              obtained highly accurate measurements of protein abundance for
              over 2,000 unique sequence variants. The resulting pool spanned
              an approximately sevenfold range of protein levels, demonstrating
              the powerful consequences of sequence manipulations of even 1-10
              nucleotides immediately upstream of the start codon. We devised
              computational models that predicted over 70\% of the measured

              out-of-frame upstream AUGs (uAUGs) to phenotypic diversity,

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Recombinant protein production is a useful
              biotechnology to produce a large quantity of highly soluble
              proteins. Currently, the most widely used production system is to
              fuse a target protein into different vectors in Escherichia coli
              (E. coli). However, the production efficacy of different vectors
              varies for different target proteins. Trial-and-error is still
              the common practice to find out the efficacy of a vector for a
              given target protein. Previous studies are limited in that they
              assumed that proteins would be over-expressed and focused only on
              the solubility of expressed proteins. In fact, many pairings of
              vectors and proteins result in no expression. RESULTS: In this
              study, we applied machine learning to train prediction models to
              predict whether a pairing of vector-protein will express or not
              express in E. coli. For expressed cases, the models further
              predict whether the expressed proteins would be soluble. We
              collected a set of real cases from the clients of our recombinant
              protein production core facility, where six different vectors
              were designed and studied. This set of cases is used in both
              training and evaluation of our models. We evaluate three
              different models based on the support vector machines (SVM) and
              their ensembles. Unlike many previous works, these models
              consider the sequence of the target protein as well as the
              sequence of the whole fusion vector as the features. We show that
              a model that classifies a case into one of the three classes (no
              expression, inclusion body and soluble) outperforms a model that
              considers the nested structure of the three classes, while a
              model that can take advantage of the hierarchical structure of
              the three classes performs slight worse but comparably to the
              best model. Meanwhile, compared to previous works, we show that
              the prediction accuracy of our best method still performs the
              best. Lastly, we briefly present two methods to use the trained
              model in the design of the recombinant protein production systems
              to improve the chance of high soluble protein production.
              CONCLUSION: In this paper, we show that a machine learning
              approach to the prediction of the efficacy of a vector for a
              target protein in a recombinant protein production system is
              promising and may compliment traditional knowledge-driven study
              of the efficacy. We will release our program to share with other
              labs in the public domain when this paper is published.",

              in all organisms studied so far. In highly expressed genes, a
              narrow set of codons is used and these codons correspond to the
              more abundant tRNA species. This minimizes the risk of tRNA
              depletion during translation. In fact, the codons in a gene may
              be true bottlenecks, especially in cases where foreign genes are
              expressed in a host in which the usage of codons in highly
              expressed genes does not resemble the usage of codons in the
              species from which the foreign gene originates. In such cases, it
              has been shown that substitution of rare codons in the introduced
              gene may increase the yield dramatically. In addition,
              replacement of rare codons might decrease the chance of
              misincorporation and protect the protein from premature turnover.

              including structural biologists and developers of protein
              pharmaceuticals. Knowledge about how intrinsic factors influence
              solubility is limited due to the difficulty of obtaining
              quantitative solubility measurements. Solubility measurements in
              buffer alone are difficult to reproduce, because gels or
              supersaturated solutions often form, making it impossible to
              determine solubility values for many proteins. Protein
              precipitants can be used to obtain comparative solubility
              measurements and, in some cases, estimations of solubility in

              salts, long-chain polymers, and organic solvents. Here, we

              precipitants, ammonium sulfate and polyethylene glycol 8000, by

              allows us to have greater flexibility in gene design for
              recombinant protein expression. Among the various parameters
              considered for such DNA sequence design, individual codon usage
              (ICU) has been implicated as one of the most crucial factors
              affecting mRNA translational efficiency. However, previous works
              have also reported the significant influence of codon pair usage,
              also known as codon context (CC), on the level of protein
              expression. RESULTS: In this study, we have developed novel
              computational procedures for evaluating the relative importance
              of optimizing ICU and CC for enhancing protein expression. By
              formulating appropriate mathematical expressions to quantify the
              ICU and CC fitness of a coding sequence, optimization procedures
              based on genetic algorithm were employed to maximize its ICU
              and/or CC fitness. Surprisingly, the in silico validation of the

              Lactococcus lactis, Pichia pastoris and Saccharomyces cerevisiae
              suggests that CC is a more relevant design criterion than the
              commonly considered ICU. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed CC

  abstract = "Almost all of the 200 or so approved biopharmaceuticals have been
              produced in one of three host systems: the bacterium Escherichia
              coli, yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pichia pastoris) and
              mammalian cells. We describe the most widely used methods for the
              expression of recombinant proteins in the cytoplasm or periplasm
              of E. coli, as well as strategies for secreting the product to
              the growth medium. Recombinant expression in E. coli influences
              the cell physiology and triggers a stress response, which has to
              be considered in process development. Increased expression of a
              functional protein can be achieved by optimizing the gene,
              plasmid, host cell, and fermentation process. Relevant properties
              of two yeast expression systems, S. cerevisiae and P. pastoris,
              are summarized. Optimization of expression in S. cerevisiae has
              focused mainly on increasing the secretion, which is otherwise
              limiting. P. pastoris was recently approved as a host for
              biopharmaceutical production for the first time. It enables
              high-level protein production and secretion. Additionally,
              genetic engineering has resulted in its ability to produce
              recombinant proteins with humanized glycosylation patterns.
              Several mammalian cell lines of either rodent or human origin are
              also used in biopharmaceutical production. Optimization of their
              expression has focused on clonal selection, interference with
              epigenetic factors and genetic engineering. Systemic optimization
              approaches are applied to all cell expression systems. They
              feature parallel high-throughput techniques, such as DNA
              microarray, next-generation sequencing and proteomics, and enable
              simultaneous monitoring of multiple parameters. Systemic
              approaches, together with technological advances such as
              disposable bioreactors and microbioreactors, are expected to lead
              to increased quality and quantity of biopharmaceuticals, as well
              as to reduced product development times.",

              protein translocation and toxin secretion, optimising recombinant
              protein expression, as well as for disease diagnosis and
              metagenomics. Results Here we explore the features of these
              signal sequences across eukaryotes. We find that different
              kingdoms have their characteristic distributions of signal
              peptide residues. Additionally, the signal peptides of secretory
              toxins have common features across kingdoms. We leverage these
              subtleties to build Razor, a simple yet powerful tool for
              annotating signal peptides, which additionally predicts toxin-
              and fungal-specific signal peptides based on the first 23
              N-terminal residues. Finally, we demonstrate the usability of
              Razor by scanning all reviewed sequences from UniProt. Indeed,
              Razor is able to identify toxins using their signal peptide
              sequences only. Strikingly, we discover that many defensive
              proteins across kingdoms harbour a toxin-like signal peptide;
              some of these defensive proteins have emerged through convergent
              evolution, e.g. defensin and defensin-like protein families, and
              phospholipase families. Availability and implementation Razor is

              Further options of JCat for codon adaptation include the

              Rho-independent transcription terminators. The output of JCat is

              Additionally, a list of genes in FASTA-format can be uploaded to
              calculate CAI values. In one example, all genes of the genome of

The major components of most venoms are peptides and proteins that are often protease-resistant due to their disulfide-rich architectures. Some of these toxins have become valuable as pharmacological tools and/or therapeutics due to their extremely high specificity and potency for particular molecular targets. There are currently six FDA-approved drugs derived from venom peptides or proteins. AREAS COVERED: This article surveys the current pipeline of venom-derived therapeutics and critically examines the potential of peptide and protein drugs derived from venoms. Emerging trends are identified, including an increasing industry focus on disulfide-rich venom peptides and the use of a broader array of molecular targets in order to develop venom-based therapeutics for treating a wider range of clinical conditions. EXPERT OPINION: Key technical advances in combination with a renewed industry-wide focus on biologics have converged to provide a larger than ever pipeline of venom-derived therapeutics. Disulfide-rich venom peptides obviate some of the traditional disadvantages of therapeutic peptides and some may be suitable for oral administration. Moreover, some venom peptides can breach the blood brain barrier and translocate across cell membranes, which opens up the possibility of exploiting molecular targets not previously accessible to peptide drugs.},

Applied to our data, the length distributions for the three regions are significantly different from expectations. For instance, the assigned hydrophobic region is between 8 and 12 residues long in almost all eukaryotic signal peptides. This analysis also makes obvious the difference between eukaryotes, Gram-positive bacteria, and Gram-negative bacteria. The model can be used to predict the location of the cleavage site, which it finds correctly in nearly 70\% of signal peptides in a cross-validated test--almost the same accuracy as the best previous method. One of the problems for existing prediction methods is the poor discrimination between signal peptides and uncleaved signal anchors, but this is substantially improved by the hidden Markov model when expanding it with a very simple signal anchor model.},

We have optimised these B-factors, and derived a new set of values for solubility scoring that further improves prediction accuracy. We call this new predictor the 'Solubility-Weighted Index' (SWI). Importantly, SWI outperforms many existing protein solubility prediction tools. Furthermore, we have developed 'SoDoPE' (Soluble Domain for Protein Expression), a web interface that allows users to choose a protein region of interest for predicting and maximising both protein expression and solubility.

The chemical composition of spider venoms is diverse, ranging from low molecular weight organic compounds such as acylpolyamines to complex peptides. First, acylpolyamines (< 1000 Da) have an aromatic moiety linked to a hydrophilic lateral chain. They were characterized for the first time in spider venoms and are ligand-gated ion channel antagonists, which block mainly postsynaptic glutamate receptors in invertebrate and vertebrate nervous systems. Acylpolyamines represent the vast majority of organic components from the spider venom. Acylpolyamine analogues have proven to suppress hippocampal epileptic discharges. Moreover, acylpolyamines could suppress excitatory postsynaptic currents inducing Ca+ accumulation in neurons leading to protection against a brain ischemic insult. Second, short spider peptides (< 6000 Da) modulate ionic currents in Ca2+, Na+, or K+ voltage-gated ion channels. Such peptides may contain from three to four disulfide bridges. Some spider peptides act specifically to discriminate among Ca2+, Na+, or K+ ion channel subtypes. Their selective affinities for ion channel subfamilies are functional for mapping excitable cells. Furthermore, several of these peptides have proven to hyperpolarize peripheral neurons, which are associated with supplying sensation to the skin and skeletal muscles. Some spider N-type calcium ion channel blockers may be important for the treatment of chronic pain. A special group of spider peptides are the amphipathic and positively charged peptides. Their secondary structure is alpha-helical and they insert into the lipid cell membrane of eukaryotic or prokaryotic cells leading to the formation of pores and subsequently depolarizing the cell membrane. Acylpolyamines and peptides from spider venoms represent an interesting source of molecules for the design of novel pharmaceutical drugs.},

It is a most remarkable mammal, not only because it lays eggs but also because it is venomous. Rather than delivering venom through a bite, as do snakes and shrews, male platypuses have venomous spurs on each hind leg. The platypus genome sequence provides a unique opportunity to unravel the evolutionary history of many of these interesting features. While searching the platypus genome for the sequences of antimicrobial defensin genes, we identified three Ornithorhynchus venom defensin-like peptide (OvDLP) genes, which produce the major components of platypus venom. We show that gene duplication and subsequent functional diversification of beta-defensins gave rise to these platypus OvDLPs. The OvDLP genes are located adjacent to the beta-defensins and share similar gene organization and peptide structures. Intriguingly, some species of snakes and lizards also produce venoms containing similar molecules called crotamines and crotamine-like peptides. This led us to trace the evolutionary origins of other components of platypus and reptile venom. Here we show that several venom components have evolved separately in the platypus and reptiles. Convergent evolution has repeatedly selected genes coding for proteins containing specific structural motifs as templates for venom molecules.},

Targeting IL-21 to strengthen the immune system is promising for the development of vaccines as well as anti-infection and anti-tumor therapies. However, the practical application of IL-21 is limited by the high production cost. In this study, we improved IL-21 production by codon optimization and selection of appropriate signal peptide in CHO-K1 cells. Codon-optimized or non-optimized human IL-21 was stably transfected into CHO-K1 cells. IL-21 expression was 10-fold higher for codon-optimized than non-optimized IL-21. We fused five different signal peptides to codon-optimized mature IL-21 and evaluated their effect on IL-21 production. The best result (a 3-fold increase) was obtained using a signal peptide derived from human azurocidin. Furthermore, codon-optimized IL-21 containing the azurocidin signal peptide promoted IFN-$\gamma$ secretion and STAT3 phosphorylation in NK-92 cells similar to codon-optimized IL-21 containing original signal peptide. Collectively, these results indicate that codon optimization and azurocidin signal peptides provide an efficient approach for the high-level production of IL-21 as a biopharmaceutical.},

  abstract     = {Spider neurotoxins are commonly used as pharmacological tools and are a popular source of novel compounds with therapeutic and agrochemical potential. Since venom peptides are inherently toxic, the host spider must employ strategies to avoid adverse effects prior to venom use. It is partly for this reason that most spider toxins encode a protective proregion that upon enzymatic cleavage is excised from the mature peptide. In order to identify the mature toxin sequence directly from toxin transcripts, without resorting to protein sequencing, the propeptide cleavage site in the toxin precursor must be predicted bioinformatically. We evaluated different machine learning strategies (support vector machines, hidden Markov model and decision tree) and developed an algorithm (SpiderP) for prediction of propeptide cleavage sites in spider toxins. Our strategy uses a support vector machine (SVM) framework that combines both local and global sequence information. Our method is superior or comparable to current tools for prediction of propeptide sequences in spider toxins. Evaluation of the SVM method on an independent test set of known toxin sequences yielded 96\% sensitivity and 100\% specificity. Furthermore, we sequenced five novel peptides (not used to train the final predictor) from the venom of the Australian tarantula Selenotypus plumipes to test the accuracy of the predictor and found 80\% sensitivity and 99.6\% 8-mer specificity. Finally, we used the predictor together with homology information to predict and characterize seven groups of novel toxins from the deeply sequenced venom gland transcriptome of S. plumipes, which revealed structural complexity and innovations in the evolution of the toxins. The precursor prediction tool (SpiderP) is freely available on ArachnoServer (http://www.arachnoserver.org/spiderP.html), a web portal to a comprehensive relational database of spider toxins. All training data, test data, and scripts used are available from the SpiderP website.},

Sporadic discoveries have also revealed endogenous toxin-like proteins in non-venomous organisms. Viral proteins are the largest group of quickly evolving proteomes. We tested the hypothesis that toxin-like proteins exist in viruses and that they act to modulate functions of their hosts. RESULTS: We updated and improved a classifier for compact proteins resembling short animal toxins that is based on a machine-learning method. We applied it in a large-scale setting to identify toxin-like proteins among short viral proteins. Among the approximately 26 000 representatives of such short proteins, 510 sequences were positively identified. We focused on the 19 highest scoring proteins. Among them, we identified conotoxin-like proteins, growth factors receptor-like proteins and anti-bacterial peptides. Our predictor was shown to enhance annotation inference for many 'uncharacterized' proteins. We conclude that our protocol can expose toxin-like proteins in unexplored niches including metagenomics data and enhance the systematic discovery of novel cell modulators for drug development.

Although this mutation impairs secretion of the hormone, the mechanism by which one mutant allele produces the autosomal-dominant disease is unexplained. Using transfected HEK293 cells, we demonstrate that the expressed mutant hormone is trapped intracellularly, predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This ER retention was found to be toxic for the cells, which underwent apoptosis, as evident from the marked increase in the number of cells staining positive for Annexin V binding and for the TUNEL reaction. The cells producing mutant hormone also had marked up-regulation of the ER stress-responsive proteins, BiP and PERK, as well as the proapoptotic transcription factor, CHOP. Up-regulation of these markers of the unfolded protein response supported a causal link between the ER stress and the cell death cascade. When the C18R PPTH was expressed in the presence of 4-phenylbutyric acid, which is a pharmacological chaperone, intracellular accumulation was reduced and normal secretion was restored. This treatment also produced remarkable reduction of ER stress signals and protection against cell death. These data implicate ER stress-induced cell death as the underlying mechanism for AD-FIH and suggest that the pharmacological manipulation of this pathway by using chemical chaperones offers a therapeutic option for treating this disease.},

Both PLA2 and LAAO from different venoms demonstrate considerable cytotoxic effects on cancer cells via induction of apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and suppression of proliferation. These enzymes produce more pronounced cytotoxic effects in cancer cells than normal cells, thus they can be potential sources as chemotherapeutic agents. It is proposed that PLA2 and LAAO contribute to an elevated oxidative stress due to their catalytic actions, for instance, the ability of PLA2 to produce reactive oxygen species during lipolysis and formation of H2O2 from LAAO catalytic activity which consequently lead to cell death. Nonetheless, the cell-death signalling pathways associated with exposure to these enzymatic toxins are not fully elucidated yet. Here in this review, we will discuss the cytotoxic effects of PLA2 and LAAO in relationship to their catalytic mechanisms and the underlying mechanisms of cytotoxic actions.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Over the past few decades, scientific research has been focused on developing peptide/protein-based therapies to treat various diseases. With the several advantages over small molecules, including high specificity, high penetration, ease of manufacturing, peptides have emerged as promising therapeutic molecules against many diseases. However, one of the bottlenecks in peptide/protein-based therapy is their toxicity. Therefore, in the present study, we developed in silico models for predicting toxicity of peptides and proteins. DESCRIPTION: We obtained toxic peptides having 35 or fewer residues from various databases for developing prediction models. Non-toxic or random peptides were obtained from SwissProt and TrEMBL. It was observed that certain residues like Cys, His, Asn, and Pro are abundant as well as preferred at various positions in toxic peptides. We developed models based on machine learning technique and quantitative matrix using various properties of peptides for predicting toxicity of peptides. The performance of dipeptide-based model in terms of accuracy was 94.50\% with MCC 0.88. In addition, various motifs were extracted from the toxic peptides and this information was combined with dipeptide-based model for developing a hybrid model. In order to evaluate the over-optimization of the best model based on dipeptide composition, we evaluated its performance on independent datasets and achieved accuracy around 90\%. Based on above study, a web server, ToxinPred has been developed, which would be helpful in predicting (i) toxicity or non-toxicity of peptides, (ii) minimum mutations in peptides for increasing or decreasing their toxicity, and (iii) toxic regions in proteins. CONCLUSION: ToxinPred is a unique in silico method of its kind, which will be useful in predicting toxicity of peptides/proteins. In addition, it will be useful in designing least toxic peptides and discovering toxic regions in proteins. We hope that the development of ToxinPred will provide momentum to peptide/protein-based drug discovery (http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/toxinpred/).},

Here we report phylogenetic analyses of venom proteome-annotated venom gland transcriptome data, assisted by genomic analyses, to show that centipede venoms have recruited at least five gene families from bacterial and fungal donors, involving at least eight horizontal gene transfer events. These results establish centipedes as currently the only known animals with venoms used in predation and defence that contain multiple gene families derived from horizontal gene transfer. The results also provide the first evidence for the implication of horizontal gene transfer in the evolutionary origin of venom in an animal lineage. Three of the bacterial gene families encode virulence factors, suggesting that horizontal gene transfer can provide a fast track channel for the evolution of novelty by the exaptation of bacterial weapons into animal venoms.},

The most common among them are phospholipases A(2) (PLA(2)s), enzymes that have two independent evolutionary origins in snake venoms. Within the group II PLA(2)s found in viperid venoms, a particular subgroup emerged, in which the otherwise conserved Asp49 of their catalytic center is replaced by Lys49. These intriguing proteins, referred to as Lys49 myotoxins, lost the ability to catalyze phospholipid hydrolysis, but still induce myonecrosis by a non-enzymatic mechanism based on membrane permeabilization as the critical event. Such mechanism is only partially understood. This review briefly describes the general structural and functional characteristics of the Lys49 myotoxins, and summarizes four proposed models of their functional ``toxic site''. Finally, it discusses some novel insights into their mode of action, in particular examining arguments and experimental observations that could shed light on the possible nature of their membrane target on skeletal muscle cells, which remains elusive.},

Understanding the snake venoms may turn the toxins into a valuable source of new lead compounds in drug discovery.

The earliest reports about snake venoms used in cancer treatments appeared in the 1930s. Since then, numerous studies on the activities, isolations, purifications and structure elucidations of the components from snake venoms were published. The comprehensive structural and functional investigations of snake venoms would contribute to the development of novel anti-cancer drugs.

Signal peptides direct the propeptide to the endoplasmic reticulum and through the secretory pathway. Although the sequences of signal peptides vary greatly, all contain a basic amino acid in the N-terminal region, followed by a hydrophobic core region. With the aim of improving the level of secretion of recombinant proteins in the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS), we designed several signal peptides based on the signal peptide of silkworm SP1 by introducing the basic amino acid arginine into the N-terminal region and/or the polar amino acid asparagine into the C-terminal region of the silkworm SP1 signal peptide. Human interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13, and the extracellular domain of human IL-11 receptor alpha1 (IL-11Ralpha1) were fused to wild-type and modified SP1 signal peptides, and the effects that each signal peptide had on secretion were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Introduction of the basic amino acid arginine into the N-terminal region did not result in an increase in secretion of the recombinant proteins. On the other hand, introduction of the polar amino acid asparagine into the C-terminal region enhanced secretion of the recombinant proteins. Therefore, it is suggested that polar amino acids in the C-terminal region of signal peptides are important in the secretion of recombinant proteins in BEVS.},

They are the key components of plant innate immune system especially systemic acquired resistance (SAR), and are widely used as diagnostic molecular markers of defense signaling pathways. Although, PR proteins and peptides have been isolated much before but their biological function remains largely enigmatic despite the availability of new scientific tools. The earlier studies have demonstrated that PR genes provide enhanced resistance against both biotic and abiotic stresses, which make them one of the most promising candidates for developing multiple stress tolerant crop varieties. In this regard, plant genetic engineering technology is widely accepted as one of the most fascinating approach to develop the disease resistant transgenic crops using different antimicrobial genes like PR genes. Overexpression of PR genes (chitinase, glucanase, thaumatin, defensin and thionin) individually or in combination have greatly uplifted the level of defense response in plants against a wide range of pathogens. However, the detailed knowledge of signaling pathways that regulates the expression of these versatile proteins is critical for improving crop plants to multiple stresses, which is the future theme of plant stress biology. Hence, this review provides an overall overview on the PR proteins like their classification, role in multiple stresses (biotic and abiotic) as well as in various plant defense signaling cascades. We also highlight the success and snags of transgenic plants expressing PR proteins and peptides.},

We decided to evaluate plastid transformation as an alternative to overcome limitations observed for nuclear transgenic technologies. The advantages include the possibilities to express polycistronic RNAs, to obtain higher protein expression levels, and the impeded gene flow due to the maternal inheritance of the plastome. We transformed Nicotiana tabacum plastids to co-express the tobacco PR proteins AP24 and $\beta$-1,3-glucanase. Transplastomic tobacco lines were characterized and subsequently challenged with Rhizoctonia solani, Peronospora hyoscyami f.sp. tabacina and Phytophthora nicotianae. Results showed that transplastomic plants expressing AP24 and $\beta$-1,3-glucanase are resistant to R. solani in greenhouse conditions and, furthermore, they are protected against P.hyoscyami f.sp. tabacina and P. nicotianae in field conditions under high inoculum pressure.

Signal peptide selection and signal peptide modification are the two main methods for the optimization of a recombinant protein secretion. However, the highly efficient signal peptide for a target protein with a specific bacterial expression host is not predictable so far. In this article, we collect several signal peptides that have previously performed well for recombinant protein secretion in gram-positive bacteria. We also discuss several factors influencing recombinant protein secretion efficiency in gram-positive bacteria. Signal peptides with a higher charge/length ratio in n-region, more consensus residues at the-3 and-1positions in c-region and a much higher proportion of coils are more likely to perform well in the secretion of recombinant proteins.

Plant defensins also have been tested as biotechnological tools to improve crop production through fungi resistance generation in organisms genetically modified (OGM).

    Synonymous codon choice can have dramatic effects on ribosome speed and
    protein expression. Ribosome profiling experiments have underscored that
    ribosomes do not move uniformly along mRNAs. Here, we have modeled this
    variation in translation elongation by using a feed-forward neural network
    to predict the ribosome density at each codon as a function of its sequence
    neighborhood. Our approach revealed sequence features affecting translation
    elongation and characterized large technical biases in ribosome profiling.
    We applied our model to design synonymous variants of a fluorescent protein
    spanning the range of translation speeds predicted with our model. Levels
    of the fluorescent protein in budding yeast closely tracked the predicted
    translation speeds across their full range. We therefore demonstrate that
    our model captures information determining translation dynamics in vivo;
    that this information can be harnessed to design coding sequences; and that
    control of translation elongation alone is sufficient to produce large
    quantitative differences in protein output.

    constructs, allowing for a similar purification procedure for most targets,
    and the implementation of high-throughput parallel methods. In most cases,
    these affinity-purified proteins are sufficiently homogeneous that a single
    subsequent gel filtration chromatography step is adequate to produce
    protein preparations that are greater than 98\% pure. Using this platform,
    over 1000 different proteins have been cloned, expressed, and purified in
    tens of milligram quantities over the last 36-month period (see Summary
    Statistics for All Targets, ). Our experience using a hierarchical
    multiplex expression and purification strategy, also described in this
    chapter, has allowed us to achieve success in producing not only protein
    samples but also many three-dimensional structures. As of December 2004,
    the NESG Consortium has deposited over 145 new protein structures to the
    Protein Data Bank (PDB); about two-thirds of these protein samples were
    produced by the NESG Protein Production Facility described here. The
    methods described here have proven effective in producing quality samples

    Protein quantification at proteome-wide scale is an important aim, enabling
    insights into fundamental cellular biology and serving to constrain
    experiments and theoretical models. While proteome-wide quantification is
    not yet fully routine, many datasets approaching proteome-wide coverage are
    becoming available through biophysical and MS techniques. Data of this type
    can be accessed via a variety of sources, including publication supplements
    and online data repositories. However, access to the data is still
    fragmentary, and comparisons across experiments and organisms are not
    straightforward. Here, we describe recent updates to our database resource
    ``PaxDb'' (Protein Abundances Across Organisms). PaxDb focuses on protein
    abundance information at proteome-wide scope, irrespective of the
    underlying measurement technique. Quantification data is reprocessed,
    unified, and quality-scored, and then integrated to build a meta-resource.
    PaxDb also allows evolutionary comparisons through precomputed gene
    orthology relations. Recently, we have expanded the scope of the database
    to include cell-line samples, and more systematically scan the literature
    for suitable datasets. We report that a significant fraction of published
    experiments cannot readily be accessed and/or parsed for quantitative
    information, requiring additional steps and efforts. The current update
    brings PaxDb to 414 datasets in 53 organisms, with (semi-) quantitative
    abundance information covering more than 300,000 proteins.

    sequences to reduce sequence redundancy and improve the performance of
    other sequence analyses. In response to the rapid increase in the amount of

    have developed a new CD-HIT program accelerated with a novel
    parallelization strategy and some other techniques to allow efficient
    clustering of such datasets. Our tests demonstrated very good speedup
    derived from the parallelization for up to \sim{}24 cores and a
    quasi-linear speedup for up to \sim{}8 cores. The enhanced CD-HIT is
    capable of handling very large datasets in much shorter time than previous

    Synonymous mutations do not alter the protein produced yet can have a
    significant effect on protein levels. The mechanisms by which this effect
    is achieved are controversial; although some previous studies have
    suggested that codon bias is the most important determinant of translation
    efficiency, a recent study suggested that mRNA folding at the beginning of
    genes is the dominant factor via its effect on translation initiation.
    Using the Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcriptomes, we
    conducted a genome-scale study aiming at dissecting the determinants of
    translation efficiency. There is a significant association between codon
    bias and translation efficiency across all endogenous genes in E. coli and
    S. cerevisiae but no association between folding energy and translation
    efficiency, demonstrating the role of codon bias as an important
    determinant of translation efficiency. However, folding energy does
    modulate the strength of association between codon bias and translation
    efficiency, which is maximized at very weak mRNA folding (i.e., high
    folding energy) levels. We find a strong correlation between the genomic
    profiles of ribosomal density and genomic profiles of folding energy across
    mRNA, suggesting that lower folding energies slow down the ribosomes and
    decrease translation efficiency. Accordingly, we find that selection forces
    act near uniformly to decrease the folding energy at the beginning of
    genes. In summary, these findings testify that in endogenous genes, folding
    energy affects translation efficiency in a global manner that is not
    related to the expression levels of individual genes, and thus cannot be
    detected by correlation with their expression levels.

    One of the main advantages of de novo gene synthesis is the fact that it
    frees the researcher from any limitations imposed by the use of natural

    are needed to calculate a coding sequence, combining different
    requirements, such as adapted codon usage or avoidance of restriction
    sites, in the best possible way. We present an algorithm where a
    ``variation window'' covering several amino acid positions slides along the

    optimized part of the complete sequence and all possible combinations of
    synonymous codons representing the amino acids within the window. The

    MOTIVATION: An important problem in synthetic biology is to design a
    nucleotide sequence of an mRNA that confers a desirable expression level of
    a target protein. The secondary structure of protein-coding sequences
    (CDSs) is one potential factor that could have both positive and negative
    effects on protein production. To elucidate the role of secondary structure
    in CDSs, algorithms for manipulating secondary structure should be
    developed. RESULTS: We developed an algorithm for designing a CDS with the
    most stable secondary structure among all possible ones translated into the
    same protein, and implemented it as the program CDSfold. The algorithm runs
    the Zuker algorithm under the constraint of a given amino acid sequence.
    The time and space complexity is O(L(3)) and O(L(2)), respectively, where L
    is the length of the CDS to be designed. Although our algorithm is slower
    than the original Zuker algorithm, it could design a relatively long
    (2.7-kb) CDS in approximately 1 h. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The
    CDSfold program is freely available for non-commercial users as stand-alone
    and web-based software from http://cdsfold.trahed.jp/cdsfold/ CONTACTS:

    In biotechnology, the use of Escherichia coli for recombinant protein
    production has a long tradition, although the optimal production conditions
    for certain proteins are still not evident. The most favorable conditions
    for protein production vary with the gene product. Temperature and
    induction conditions represent parameters that affect total protein
    production, as well as the amount of soluble protein. Furthermore, the
    choice of promoter and bacterial strain will have large effects on the
    production of the target protein. In the present study, the effects of
    three different promoters (T7, trc and lacUV5) on E. coli production of
    target proteins with different characteristics are presented. The total
    amount of target protein as well as the amount of soluble protein were
    analyzed, demonstrating the benefits of using a strong promoter such as T7.
    To understand the underlying causes, transcription levels have been
    correlated with the total amount of target protein and protein solubility
    in vitro has been correlated with the amount of soluble protein that is
    produced. In addition, the effects of two different E. coli strains,
    BL21(DE3) and Rosetta(DE3), on the expression pattern were analyzed. It is
    concluded that the regulation of protein production is a combination of the
    transcription and translation efficiencies. Other important parameters
    include the nucleotide-sequence itself and the solubility of the target
    protein.

    Different codon optimization algorithms are available that aim at improving
    protein production by optimizing translation elongation. In these
    algorithms, it is generally not considered how the altered protein coding
    sequence will affect the secondary structure of the corresponding RNA
    transcript, particularly not the effect on the 5'-UTR structure and related
    ribosome binding site availability. This is a serious drawback, because the
    influence of codon usage on mRNA secondary structures, especially near the
    start of a gene, may strongly influence translation initiation. In this
    study, we aim to reduce the effect of codon usage on translation initiation
    by applying a bicistronic design (BCD) element. Protein production of
    several codon-optimized gene variants is tested in parallel for a BCD and a
    standard monocistronic design (MCD). We demonstrate that these distinct
    architectures can drastically change the relative performance of different
    codon optimization algorithms. We conclude that a BCD is indispensable in
    future studies that aim to reveal the impact of codon optimization and
    codon usage correlations. Furthermore, irrespective of the algorithm used,
    using a BCD does improve protein production compared with an MCD. The
    overall highest expression from BCDs for both GFP and RFP is at least
    twofold higher than the highest levels found for the MCDs, while for codon
    variants having very low expression from the MCD, even 10-fold to 100-fold
    increases in expression were achieved by the BCD. This shows the great
    potential of the BCD element for recombinant protein production.

    We precisely designed 244,000 DNA sequences implementing 56 replicates of a
    full factorial design to evaluate nucleotide, secondary structure, codon
    and amino acid properties in combination. For each sequence, we measured
    reporter transcript abundance and decay, polysome profiles, protein
    production and growth rates. Associations between designed sequences
    properties and these consequent phenotypes were dominated by secondary
    structures and their interactions within transcripts. We confirmed that
    transcript structure generally limits translation initiation and
    demonstrated its physiological cost using an epigenetic assay. Codon
    composition has a sizable impact on translatability, but only in
    comparatively rare elongation-limited transcripts. We propose a set of
    design principles to improve translation efficiency that would benefit from
    more accurate prediction of secondary structures in vivo.

    and protein levels correlated better than previously thought, corresponding
    half-lives showed no correlation. Using a quantitative model we have

    Abstract The investigation of membrane proteins, key constituents of cells,

    of unpredictable yield. Cell-free synthesis is herein employed to unravel
    the impact of the expression construct on gene transcription and
    translation, without the complex regulatory mechanisms of cellular systems.
    Through the systematic design of plasmids in the immediacy of the start of
    the target gene, it was possible to identify translation initiation and the
    conformation of mRNA as the main factors governing the cell-free expression
    efficiency of the human voltage dependent anion channel (VDAC), a relevant
    membrane protein in drug-based therapy. A simple translation initiation
    model was developed to quantitatively assess the expression potential for
    the designed constructs. A scoring function is proposed that quantifies the
    feasibility of formation of the translation initiation complex through the
    ribosome-mRNA hybridization energy and the accessibility of the mRNA
    segment binding to the ribosome. The scoring function enables to optimize
    plasmid sequences and semi-quantitatively predict protein expression

    ribosome profiling, for measuring absolute protein synthesis rates. The
    resultant E. coli data set transforms our understanding of the extent to
    which protein synthesis is precisely controlled to optimize function and
    efficiency. Members of multiprotein complexes are made in precise
    proportion to their stoichiometry, whereas components of functional modules
    are produced differentially according to their hierarchical role. Estimates
    of absolute protein abundance also reveal principles for optimizing design.
    These include how the level of different types of transcription factors is
    optimized for rapid response and how a metabolic pathway (methionine
    biosynthesis) balances production cost with activity requirements. Our
    studies reveal how general principles, important both for understanding
    natural systems and for synthesizing new ones, emerge from quantitative
    analyses of protein synthesis.

    BACKGROUND: Direct synthesis of genes is rapidly becoming the most
    efficient way to make functional genetic constructs and enables
    applications such as codon optimization, RNAi resistant genes and protein
    engineering. Here we introduce a software tool that drastically facilitates
    the design of synthetic genes. RESULTS: Gene Designer is a stand-alone
    software for fast and easy design of synthetic DNA segments. Users can
    easily add, edit and combine genetic elements such as promoters, open
    reading frames and tags through an intuitive drag-and-drop graphic
    interface and a hierarchical DNA/Protein object map. Using advanced
    optimization algorithms, open reading frames within the DNA construct can
    readily be codon optimized for protein expression in any host organism.
    Gene Designer also includes features such as a real-time sliding calculator
    of oligonucleotide annealing temperatures, sequencing primer generator,
    tools for avoidance or inclusion of restriction sites, and options to
    maximize or minimize sequence identity to a reference. CONCLUSION: Gene
    Designer is an expandable Synthetic Biology workbench suitable for
    molecular biologists interested in the de novo creation of genetic
    constructs.

    Yeasts combine the ease of genetic manipulation and fermentation of a
    microorganism with the capability to secrete and modify foreign proteins
    according to a general eukaryotic scheme. Their rapid growth,
    microbiological safety, and high-density fermentation in simplified medium
    have a high impact particularly in the large-scale industrial production of
    foreign proteins, where secretory expression is important for simplifying
    the downstream protein purification process. However, secretory expression
    of heterologous proteins in yeast is often subject to several bottlenecks
    that limit yield. Thus, many studies on yeast secretion systems have
    focused on the engineering of the fermentation process, vector systems, and
    host strains. Recently, strain engineering by genetic modification has been
    the most useful and effective method for overcoming the drawbacks in yeast
    secretion pathways. Such an approach is now being promoted strongly by
    current post-genomic technology and system biology tools. However,
    engineering of the yeast secretion system is complicated by the involvement
    of many cross-reacting factors. Tight interdependence of each of these
    factors makes genetic modification difficult. This indicates the necessity
    of developing a novel systematic modification strategy for genetic
    engineering of the yeast secretion system. This mini-review focuses on
    recent strategies and their advantages for systematic engineering of yeast

    RNA performs a diverse array of important functions across all cellular

    Much of the information available about factors that affect mRNA decay in
    Escherichia coli, and by inference in other bacteria, has been gleaned from
    study of less than 25 of the approximately 4,300 predicted E. coli
    messages. To investigate these factors more broadly, we examined the
    half-lives and steady-state abundance of known and predicted E. coli mRNAs
    at single-gene resolution by using two-color fluorescent DNA microarrays.
    An rRNA-based strategy for normalization of microarray data was developed
    to permit quantitation of mRNA decay after transcriptional arrest by
    rifampicin. We found that globally, mRNA half-lives were similar in
    nutrient-rich media and defined media in which the generation time was
    approximately tripled. A wide range of stabilities was observed for
    individual mRNAs of E. coli, although approximately 80\% of all mRNAs had
    half-lives between 3 and 8 min. Genes having biologically related metabolic
    functions were commonly observed to have similar stabilities. Whereas the
    half-lives of a limited number of mRNAs correlated positively with their
    abundance, we found that overall, increased mRNA stability is not
    predictive of increased abundance. Neither the density of putative sites of
    cleavage by RNase E, which is believed to initiate mRNA decay in E. coli,
    nor the free energy of folding of 5' or 3' untranslated region sequences
    was predictive of mRNA half-life. Our results identify previously
    unsuspected features of mRNA decay at a global level and also indicate that
    generalizations about decay derived from the study of individual gene
    transcripts may have limited applicability.

    Phenotypic plasticity of microbial cells has attracted much attention and
    several research efforts have been dedicated to the description of methods
    aiming at characterizing phenotypic heterogeneity and its impact on
    microbial populations. However, different approaches have also been
    suggested in order to take benefit from noise in a bioprocess perspective,
    e.g. by increasing the robustness or productivity of a microbial
    population. This review is dedicated to outline these controlling methods.
    A common issue, that has still to be addressed, is the experimental
    identification and the mathematical expression of noise. Indeed, the
    effective interfacing of microbial physiology with external parameters that
    can be used for controlling physiology depends on the acquisition of
    reliable signals. Latest technologies, like single cell microfluidics and
    advanced flow cytometric approaches, enable linking physiology, noise,
    heterogeneity in productive microbes with environmental cues and hence
    allow correctly mapping and predicting biological behavior via mathematical
    representations. However, like in the field of electronics, signals are
    perpetually subjected to noise. If appropriately interpreted, this noise
    can give an additional insight into the behavior of the individual cells
    within a microbial population of interest. This review focuses on recent
    progress made at describing, treating and exploiting biological noise in
    the context of microbial populations used in various bioprocess

    Translation initiation in eukaryotes is a complex process involving many
    factors. A key step in this process is the binding of mRNA to the 43S
    preinitiation complex. This is generally the rate-limiting step in
    translation initiation and consequently a major determinant of mRNA
    translational efficiency. The primary and secondary structure of the mRNA
    5' noncoding region have been implicated in modulating translational
    efficiency. Translational efficiency was shown to be inversely proportional
    to the degree of secondary structure at the mRNA 5' noncoding region.
    Furthermore, it was shown that cap-binding proteins that interact with the
    5' cap structure (m7GpppN) of eukaryotic mRNAs are involved in the
    ``unwinding'' of the mRNA secondary structure, in an ATP hydrolysis
    mediated event, to facilitate ribosome binding. Thus, cap-binding proteins
    can potentially regulate mRNA translation. Here, we discuss the available

    Recently large scale transcriptome and proteome datasets for human cells
    have become available. A striking finding from these studies is that the
    level of an mRNA typically predicts no more than 40\% of the abundance of
    protein. This correlation represents the overall figure for all genes. We
    present here a bioinformatic analysis of translation efficiency - the rate
    at which mRNA is translated into protein. We have analysed those human
    datasets that include genome wide mRNA and protein levels determined in the
    same study. The analysis comprises five distinct human cell lines that
    together provide comparable data for 8,170 genes. For each gene we have
    used levels of mRNA and protein combined with protein stability data from
    the HeLa cell line to estimate translation efficiency. This was possible
    for 3,990 genes in one or more cell lines and 1,807 genes in all five cell
    lines. Interestingly, our analysis and modelling shows that for many genes
    this estimated translation efficiency has considerable consistency between
    cell lines. Some deviations from this consistency likely result from the
    regulation of protein degradation. Others are likely due to known
    translational control mechanisms. These findings suggest it will be
    possible to build improved models for the interpretation of mRNA expression
    data. The results we present here provide a view of translation efficiency
    for many genes. We provide an online resource allowing the exploration of
    translation efficiency in genes of interest within different cell lines

    Abstract Recombinant protein production in microbial systems is

    proteins, but for others, codon bias, mRNA folding, avoidance, and G+C
    content have been suggested to explain observed levels of protein
    expression. However, determining which of these is the strongest predictor
    is still an active area of research. We used an ensemble average of energy
    model for RNA to show that the accessibility of translation initiation
    sites outperforms other features in predicting the outcomes of 11,430
    experiments of recombinant protein production in Escherichia coli. We
    developed TIsigner and showed that synonymous codon changes within the
    first nine codons are sufficient to improve the accessibility of
    translation initiation sites. Our software produces scores for both input
    and optimised sequences, so that success/failure can be predicted and

    Secondary structure of messenger RNA plays an important role in the
    bio-synthesis of proteins. Its negative impact on translation can reduce
    the yield of protein by slowing or blocking the initiation and movement of
    ribosomes along the mRNA, becoming a major factor in the regulation of gene
    expression. Several algorithms can predict the formation of secondary
    structures by calculating the minimum free energy of RNA sequences, or
    perform the inverse process of obtaining an RNA sequence for a given
    structure. However, there is still no approach to redesign an mRNA to
    achieve minimal secondary structure without affecting the amino acid
    sequence. Here we present the first strategy to optimize mRNA secondary
    structures, to increase (or decrease) the minimum free energy of a
    nucleotide sequence, without changing its resulting polypeptide, in a
    time-efficient manner, through a simplistic approximation to hairpin
    formation. Our data show that this approach can efficiently increase the
    minimum free energy by >40\%, strongly reducing the strength of secondary
    structures. Applications of this technique range from multi-objective
    optimization of genes by controlling minimum free energy together with CAI
    and other gene expression variables, to optimization of secondary
    structures at the genomic level.

    We have quantitatively analyzed the relationship between translational
    efficiency and the mRNA secondary structure in the initiation region. The
    stability of a defined hairpin structure containing a ribosome binding site
    was varied over 12 kcal/mol (1 cal = 4.184 J) by site-directed mutagenesis
    and the effects on protein yields were analyzed in vivo. The results reveal
    a strict correlation between translational efficiency and the stability of
    the helix. An increase in its delta G0 of -1.4 kcal/mol (i.e., less than
    the difference between an A.U and a G.C pair) corresponds to the reduction
    by a factor of 10 in initiation rate. Accordingly, a single nucleotide
    substitution led to the decrease by a factor of 500 in expression because
    it turned a mismatch in the helix into a match. We find no evidence that
    exposure of only the Shine-Dalgarno region or the start codon
    preferentially favors recognition. Translational efficiency is strictly
    correlated with the fraction of mRNA molecules in which the ribosome
    binding site is unfolded, indicating that initiation is completely
    dependent on spontaneous unfolding of the entire initiation region.
    Ribosomes appear not to recognize nucleotides outside the Shine-Dalgarno
    region and the initiation codon.

    an extension of structural alignments to an explicit scoring of stacking

    MOTIVATION: As more non-coding RNAs are discovered, the importance of
    methods for RNA analysis increases. Since the structure of ncRNA is
    intimately tied to the function of the molecule, programs for RNA structure
    prediction are necessary tools in this growing field of research.
    Furthermore, it is known that RNA structure is often evolutionarily more
    conserved than sequence. However, few existing methods are capable of
    simultaneously considering multiple sequence alignment and structure
    prediction. RESULT: We present a novel solution to the problem of
    simultaneous structure prediction and multiple alignment of RNA sequences.
    Using Markov chain Monte Carlo in a simulated annealing framework, the
    algorithm MASTR (Multiple Alignment of STructural RNAs) iteratively
    improves both sequence alignment and structure prediction for a set of RNA
    sequences. This is done by minimizing a combined cost function that
    considers sequence conservation, covariation and basepairing probabilities.
    The results show that the method is very competitive to similar programs
    available today, both in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.

    The 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of mRNAs contains elements that affect
    expression, yet the rules by which these regions exert their effect are
    poorly understood. Here, we studied the impact of 5'-UTR sequences on
    protein levels in yeast, by constructing a large-scale library of mutants
    that differ only in the 10 bp preceding the translational start site of a
    fluorescent reporter. Using a high-throughput sequencing strategy, we
    obtained highly accurate measurements of protein abundance for over 2,000
    unique sequence variants. The resulting pool spanned an approximately
    sevenfold range of protein levels, demonstrating the powerful consequences
    of sequence manipulations of even 1-10 nucleotides immediately upstream of
    the start codon. We devised computational models that predicted over 70\%
    of the measured expression variability in held-out sequence variants.
    Notably, a combined model of the most prominent features successfully
    explained protein abundance in an additional, independently constructed
    library, whose nucleotide composition differed greatly from the library
    used to parameterize the model. Our analysis reveals the dominant
    contribution of the start codon context at positions -3 to -1, mRNA
    secondary structure, and out-of-frame upstream AUGs (uAUGs) to phenotypic
    diversity, thereby advancing our understanding of how protein levels are
    modulated by 5'-UTR sequences, and paving the way toward predictably tuning
    protein expression through manipulations of 5'-UTRs.

    In the process of clone-based genome sequencing, initial assemblies
    frequently contain cloning gaps that can be resolved using
    cloning-independent methods, but the reason for their occurrence is largely
    unknown. By analyzing 9,328,693 sequencing clones from 393 microbial
    genomes, we systematically mapped more than 15,000 genes residing in
    cloning gaps and experimentally showed that their expression products are
    toxic to the Escherichia coli host. A subset of these toxic sequences was
    further evaluated through a series of functional assays exploring the
    mechanisms of their toxicity. Among these genes, our assays revealed novel
    toxins and restriction enzymes, and new classes of small, non-coding toxic
    RNAs that reproducibly inhibit E. coli growth. Further analyses also
    revealed abundant, short, toxic DNA fragments that were predicted to
    suppress E. coli growth by interacting with the replication initiator DnaA.
    Our results show that cloning gaps, once considered the result of technical
    problems, actually serve as a rich source for the discovery of
    biotechnologically valuable functions, and suggest new modes of
    antimicrobial interventions.

    v0.9.0 (July 2018) Note: a version of these release notes with working
    links appears in the online documentation. This is a major release with
    several substantial and long-desired new features. There are also
    updates/modifications to the themes and color palettes that give better
    consistency with matplotlib 2.0 and some notable API changes. New
    relational plots Three completely new plotting functions have been added:
    catplot, scatterplot, and lineplot. The first is a figure-level interface
    to the latter two that combines them with a FacetGrid. The functions bring
    the high-level, dataset-oriented API of the seaborn categorical plotting
    functions to more general plots (scatter plots and line plots). These
    functions can visualize a relationship between two numeric variables while
    mapping up to three additional variables by modifying hue, size, and/or
    style semantics. The common high-level API is implemented differently in
    the two functions. For example, the size semantic in scatterplot scales the
    area of scatter plot points, but in lineplot it scales width of the line
    plot lines. The API is dataset-oriented, meaning that in both cases you
    pass the variable in your dataset rather than directly specifying the
    matplotlib parameters to use for point area or line width. Another way the
    relational functions differ from existing seaborn functionality is that
    they have better support for using numeric variables for hue and size
    semantics. This functionality may be propagated to other functions that can
    add a hue semantic in future versions; it has not been in this release. The
    lineplot function also has support for statistical estimation and is
    replacing the older tsplot function, which still exists but is marked for
    removal in a future release. lineplot is better aligned with the API of the
    rest of the library and more flexible in showing relationships across
    additional variables by modifying the size and style semantics
    independently. It also has substantially improved support for date and time
    data, a major pain factor in tsplot. The cost is that some of the more
    esoteric options in tsplot for representing uncertainty (e.g. a colormapped
    KDE of the bootstrap distribution) have not been implemented in the new
    function. There is quite a bit of new documentation that explains these new
    functions in more detail, including detailed examples of the various
    options in the API reference and a more verbose tutorial. These functions
    should be considered in a ``stable beta'' state. They have been thoroughly
    tested, but some unknown corner cases may remain to be found. The main
    features are in place, but not all planned functionality has been
    implemented. There are planned improvements to some elements, particularly
    the default legend, that are a little rough around the edges in this
    release. Finally, some of the default behavior (e.g. the default range of
    point/line sizes) may change somewhat in future releases. Updates to themes
    and palettes Several changes have been made to the seaborn style themes,
    context scaling, and color palettes. In general the aim of these changes
    was to make the seaborn styles more consistent with the style updates in
    matplotlib 2.0 and to leverage some of the new style parameters for better
    implementation of some aspects of the seaborn styles. Here is a list of the
    changes: Reorganized and updated some axes\_style/plotting\_context
    parameters to take advantage of improvements in the matplotlib 2.0 update.
    The biggest change involves using several new parameterss in the ``style''
    spec while moving parameters that used to implement the corresponding
    aesthetics to the ``context'' spec. For example, axes spines and ticks are
    now off instead of having their width/length zeroed out for the darkgrid
    style. That means the width/length of these elements can now be scaled in
    different contexts. The effect is a more cohesive appearance of the plots,
    especially in larger contexts. These changes include only minimal support
    for the 1.x matplotlib series. Users who are stuck on matplotlib 1.5 but
    wish to use seaborn styling may want to use the seaborn parameters that can
    be accessed through the matplotlib stylesheet interface. Updated the
    seaborn palettes (``deep'', ``muted'', ``colorblind'', etc.) to correspond
    with the new 10-color matplotlib default. The legacy palettes are now
    available at ``deep6'', ``muted6'', ``colorblind6'', etc. Additionally, a
    few individual colors were tweaked for better consistency, aesthetics, and
    accessibility. Calling color\_palette (or set\_palette) with a named
    qualitative palettes (i.e. one of the seaborn palettes, the colorbrewer
    qualitative palettes, or the matplotlib matplotlib tableau-derived
    palettes) and no specified number of colors will return all of the colors
    in the palette. This means that for some palettes, the returned list will
    have a different length than it did in previous versions. Enhanced
    color\_palette to accept a parameterized specification of a cubehelix
    palette in in a string, prefixed with ``ch:'' (e.g. ``ch:-.1,.2,l=.7'').
    Note that keyword arguments can be spelled out or referenced using only
    their first letter. Reversing the palette is accomplished by appending
    ``\_r'', as with other matplotlib colormaps. This specification will be
    accepted by any seaborn function with a palette= parameter. Slightly
    increased the base font sizes in plotting\_context and increased the
    scaling factors for ``talk'' and ``poster'' contexts. Calling set will now
    call set\_color\_codes to re-assign the single letter color codes by
    default API changes A few functions have been renamed or have had changes
    to their default parameters. The factorplot function has been renamed to
    catplot. The new name ditches the original R-inflected terminology to use a
    name that is more consistent with terminology in pandas and in seaborn
    itself. This change should hopefully make catplot easier to discover, and
    it should make more clear what its role is. factorplot still exists and
    will pass its arguments through to catplot with a warning. It may be
    removed eventually, but the transition will be as gradual as possible. The
    other reason that the factorplot name was changed was to ease another
    alteration which is that the default kind in catplot is now ``strip''
    (corresponding to stripplot). This plots a categorical scatter plot which
    is usually a much better place to start and is more consistent with the
    default in relplot. The old default style in factorplot (``point'',
    corresponding to pointplot) remains available if you want to show a
    statistical estimation. The lvplot function has been renamed to boxenplot.
    The ``letter-value'' terminology that was used to name the original kind of
    plot is obscure, and the abbreviation to lv did not help anything. The new
    name should make the plot more discoverable by describing its format (it
    plots multiple boxes, also known as ``boxen''). As with factorplot, the
    lvplot function still exists to provide a relatively smooth transition.
    Renamed the size parameter to height in multi-plot grid objects (FacetGrid,
    PairGrid, and JointGrid) along with functions that use them (factorplot,
    lmplot, pairplot, and jointplot) to avoid conflicts with the size parameter
    that is used in scatterplot and lineplot (necessary to make relplot work)
    and also makes the meaning of the parameter a bit more clear. Changed the
    default diagonal plots in pairplot to use `func`:kdeplot` when a ``hue''
    dimension is used. Deprecated the statistical annotation component of
    JointGrid. The method is still available but will be removed in a future
    version. Two older functions that were deprecated in earlier versions,
    coefplot and interactplot, have undergone final removal from the code base.
    Documentation improvements There has been some effort put into improving
    the documentation. The biggest change is that the introduction to the
    library has been completely rewritten to provide much more information and,
    critically, examples. In addition to the high-level motivation, the
    introduction also covers some important topics that are often sources of
    confusion, like the distinction between figure-level and axes-level
    functions, how datasets should be formatted for use in seaborn, and how to
    customize the appearance of the plots. Other improvements have been made
    throughout, most notably a thorough re-write of the categorical tutorial
    categorical\_tutorial. Other small enhancements and bug fixes Changed
    rugplot to plot a matplotlib LineCollection instead of many Line2D objects,
    providing a big speedup for large arrays. Changed the default off-diagonal
    plots to use scatterplot. (Note that the ``hue'' currently draws three
    separate scatterplots instead of using the hue semantic of the scatterplot
    function). Changed color handling when using kdeplot with two variables.
    The default colormap for the 2D density now follows the color cycle, and
    the function can use color and label kwargs, adding more flexibility and
    avoiding a warning when using with multi-plot grids. Added the subplot\_kws
    parameter to PairGrid for more flexibility. Removed a special case in
    PairGrid that defaulted to drawing stacked histograms on the diagonal axes.
    Fixed jointplot/JointGrid and regplot so that they now accept list inputs.
    Fixed a bug in FacetGrid when using a single row/column level or using
    col\_wrap=1. Fixed functions that set axis limits so that they preserve
    auto-scaling state on matplotlib 2.0. Avoided an error when using
    matplotlib backends that cannot render a canvas (e.g. PDF). Changed the
    install infrastructure to explicitly declare dependencies in a way that pip
    is aware of. This means that pip install seaborn will now work in an empty
    environment. Additionally, the dependencies are specified with strict
    minimal versions. Updated the testing infrastructure to execute tests with
    pytest (although many individual tests still use nose assertion).

    BACKGROUND: A large class of RNA secondary structure prediction programs
    uses an elaborate energy model grounded in extensive thermodynamic
    measurements and exact dynamic programming algorithms. External
    experimental evidence can be in principle be incorporated by means of hard
    constraints that restrict the search space or by means of soft constraints
    that distort the energy model. In particular recent advances in coupling
    chemical and enzymatic probing with sequencing techniques but also
    comparative approaches provide an increasing amount of experimental data to
    be combined with secondary structure prediction. RESULTS: Responding to the
    increasing needs for a versatile and user-friendly inclusion of external
    evidence into diverse flavors of RNA secondary structure prediction tools
    we implemented a generic layer of constraint handling into the ViennaRNA
    Package. It makes explicit use of the conceptual separation of the
    ``folding grammar'' defining the search space and the actual energy
    evaluation, which allows constraints to be interleaved in a natural way
    between recursion steps and evaluation of the standard energy function.
    CONCLUSIONS: The extension of the ViennaRNA Package provides a generic way
    to include diverse types of constraints into RNA folding algorithms. The
    computational overhead incurred is negligible in practice. A wide variety
    of application scenarios can be accommodated by the new framework,
    including the incorporation of structure probing data, non-standard base
    pairs and chemical modifications, as well as structure-dependent ligand
    binding.

    Differential fluorescent labeling of bacteria has become instrumental for

    utility of the plasmids and transposons was tested in bacteria from the
    phyla Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. We were able to
    tag representatives from the phylum Proteobacteria at least via our Tn
    transposon delivery system. The present study enables labeling bacteria
    with a set of plasmids available to the community. One potential
    application of fluorescently-tagged bacterial species is the study of
    bacteria-bacteria, bacteria-host, and bacteria-environment interactions.

    For monitoring the expression profile of selected nuclear genes in
    Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in response to altered environmental parameters
    or during cell cycle, in the past many RNA or protein samples had to be
    taken and analyzed by RNA hybridization or protein immunoblotting. Here we
    report the synthesis of a gene that codes for the luciferase of Renilla
    reniformis (RLuc) and is adapted to the nuclear codon usage of C.
    reinhardtii . This crluc gene was expressed alone or as a fusion to the
    zeocin resistance gene ble under control of different promoter variants.
    Luciferase activity was monitored in living cells, increased with the
    promoter strength and paralleled the amount of expressed protein. Under
    control of the Lhcb-1 promoter the Luc-activity in synchronized cultures
    was dependent on the dark-light cycle. Additionally, crluc was placed under
    control of the Chop-2 promoter and activity was measured under different
    light conditions. Chop-2 promoter activity was found to be most pronouced
    under low-light and dark conditions, further supporting that
    channelrhodopsin-2 is most active in dark-adapted cells. We conclude that

    Despite considerable efforts, no physical mechanism has been shown to
    explain N-terminal codon bias in prokaryotic genomes. Using a systematic
    study of synonymous substitutions in two endogenous E. coli genes, we show
    that interactions between the coding region and the upstream Shine-Dalgarno
    (SD) sequence modulate the efficiency of translation initiation, affecting
    both intracellular mRNA and protein levels due to the inherent coupling of
    transcription and translation in E. coli. We further demonstrate that
    far-downstream mutations can also modulate mRNA levels by occluding the SD
    sequence through the formation of non-equilibrium secondary structures. By
    contrast, a non-endogenous RNA polymerase that decouples transcription and
    translation largely alleviates the effects of synonymous substitutions on
    mRNA levels. Finally, a complementary statistical analysis of the E. coli
    genome specifically implicates avoidance of intra-molecular base pairing
    with the SD sequence. Our results provide general physical insights into
    the coding-level features that optimize protein expression in prokaryotes.

    Objectives Assessing high-sensitivity tests for mortal illness is crucial
    in emergency and critical care medicine. Estimating the 95\% confidence
    interval (CI) of the likelihood ratio (LR) can be challenging when sample
    sensitivity is 100\%. We aimed to develop, compare, and automate a
    bootstrapping method to estimate the negative LR CI when sample sensitivity
    is 100\%. Methods The lowest population sensitivity that is most likely to
    yield sample sensitivity 100\% is located using the binomial distribution.
    Random binomial samples generated using this population sensitivity are
    then used in the LR bootstrap. A free R program, ``bootLR,'' automates the
    process. Extensive simulations were performed to determine how often the LR
    bootstrap and comparator method 95\% CIs cover the true population negative
    LR value. Finally, the 95\% CI was compared for theoretical sample sizes
    and sensitivities approaching and including 100\% using: (1) a technique of
    individual extremes, (2) SAS software based on the technique of Gart and
    Nam, (3) the Score CI (as implemented in the StatXact, SAS, and R PropCI
    package), and (4) the bootstrapping technique. Results The bootstrapping
    approach demonstrates appropriate coverage of the nominal 95\% CI over a
    spectrum of populations and sample sizes. Considering a study of sample
    size 200 with 100 patients with disease, and specificity 60\%, the lowest
    population sensitivity with median sample sensitivity 100\% is 99.31\%.
    When all 100 patients with disease test positive, the negative LR 95\% CIs
    are: individual extremes technique (0,0.073), StatXact (0,0.064), SAS Score
    method (0,0.057), R PropCI (0,0.062), and bootstrap (0,0.048). Similar
    trends were observed for other sample sizes. Conclusions When study samples
    demonstrate 100\% sensitivity, available methods may yield inappropriately
    wide negative LR CIs. An alternative bootstrapping approach and
    accompanying free open-source R package were developed to yield realistic
    estimates easily. This methodology and implementation are applicable to
    other binomial proportions with homogeneous responses.

    A modular and hierarchical DNA assembly platform for synthetic biology
    based on Golden Gate (Type IIS restriction enzyme) cloning is described.
    This enabling technology, termed MIDAS (for Modular Idempotent DNA Assembly
    System), can be used to precisely assemble multiple DNA fragments in a
    single reaction using a standardized assembly design. It can be used to
    build genes from libraries of sequence-verified, reusable parts and to
    assemble multiple genes in a single vector, with full user control over
    gene order and orientation, as well as control of the direction of growth
    (polarity) of the multigene assembly, a feature that allows genes to be
    nested between other genes or genetic elements. We describe the detailed
    design and use of MIDAS, exemplified by the reconstruction, in the
    filamentous fungus Penicillium paxilli, of the metabolic pathway for
    production of paspaline and paxilline, key intermediates in the
    biosynthesis of a range of indole diterpenes-a class of secondary
    metabolites produced by several species of filamentous fungi. MIDAS was
    used to efficiently assemble a 25.2 kb plasmid from 21 different modules
    (seven genes, each composed of three basic parts). By using a parts
    library-based system for construction of complex assemblies, and a unique
    set of vectors, MIDAS can provide a flexible route to assembling tailored
    combinations of genes and other genetic elements, thereby supporting
    synthetic biology applications in a wide range of expression hosts.

    A critical assumption of gene expression analysis is that mRNA abundances
    broadly correlate with protein abundance, but these two are often

    important mRNA features: codon usage and mRNA secondary structure. We
    present a new global factor, called mRNA:ncRNA avoidance, and provide
    evidence that avoidance increases translational efficiency. We also
    demonstrate a strong selection for the avoidance of stochastic mRNA:ncRNA
    interactions across prokaryotes, and that these have a greater impact on
    protein abundance than mRNA structure or codon usage. By generating
    synonymously variant green fluorescent protein (GFP) mRNAs with different
    potential for mRNA:ncRNA interactions, we demonstrate that GFP levels

    Many organisms are subject to selective pressure that gives rise to unequal

    the mechanisms of selection on synonymous sites, we expressed several
    hundred synonymous variants of the GFP gene in Escherichia coli, and used
    quantitative growth and viability assays to estimate bacterial fitness.
    Unexpectedly, we found many synonymous variants whose expression was toxic
    to E. coli Unlike previously studied effects of synonymous mutations, the
    effect that we discovered is independent of translation, but it depends on
    the production of toxic mRNA molecules. We identified RNA sequence
    determinants of toxicity and evolved suppressor strains that can tolerate
    the expression of toxic GFP variants. Genome sequencing of these suppressor
    strains revealed a cluster of promoter mutations that prevented toxicity by
    reducing mRNA levels. We conclude that translation-independent RNA toxicity

    BACKGROUND: Production of proteins as therapeutic agents, research reagents
    and molecular tools frequently depends on expression in heterologous hosts.
    Synthetic genes are increasingly used for protein production because
    sequence information is easier to obtain than the corresponding physical
    DNA. Protein-coding sequences are commonly re-designed to enhance
    expression, but there are no experimentally supported design principles.
    PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To identify sequence features that affect protein
    expression we synthesized and expressed in E. coli two sets of 40 genes
    encoding two commercially valuable proteins, a DNA polymerase and a single
    chain antibody. Genes differing only in synonymous codon usage expressed
    protein at levels ranging from undetectable to 30\% of cellular protein.
    Using partial least squares regression we tested the correlation of protein
    production levels with parameters that have been reported to affect
    expression. We found that the amount of protein produced in E. coli was
    strongly dependent on the codons used to encode a subset of amino acids.
    Favorable codons were predominantly those read by tRNAs that are most
    highly charged during amino acid starvation, not codons that are most
    abundant in highly expressed E. coli proteins. Finally we confirmed the
    validity of our models by designing, synthesizing and testing new genes
    using codon biases predicted to perform well. CONCLUSION: The systematic
    analysis of gene design parameters shown in this study has allowed us to
    identify codon usage within a gene as a critical determinant of achievable
    protein expression levels in E. coli. We propose a biochemical basis for
    this, as well as design algorithms to ensure high protein production from
    synthetic genes. Replication of this methodology should allow similar
    design algorithms to be empirically derived for any expression system.

    The genetic code, which defines the amino acid sequence of a protein, also
    contains information that influences the rate and efficiency of
    translation. Neither the mechanisms nor functions of codon-mediated
    regulation were well understood. The prevailing model was that the slow
    translation of codons decoded by rare tRNAs reduces efficiency. Recent
    genome-wide analyses have clarified several issues. Specific codons and
    codon combinations modulate ribosome speed and facilitate protein folding.
    However, tRNA availability is not the sole determinant of rate; rather,
    interactions between adjacent codons and wobble base pairing are key. One
    mechanism linking translation efficiency and codon use is that slower
    decoding is coupled to reduced mRNA stability. Changes in tRNA supply
    mediate biological regulationfor instance,, changes in tRNA amounts

    Deducing generic causal relations between RNA transcript features and
    protein expression profiles from endogenous gene expression data remains a
    major unsolved problem in biology. The analysis of gene expression from
    heterologous genes contributes significantly to solving this problem, but
    has been heavily biased toward the study of the effect of 5' transcript
    regions and to prokaryotes. Here, we employ a synthetic biology driven
    approach that systematically differentiates the effect of different regions
    of the transcript on gene expression up to 240 nucleotides into the ORF.
    This enabled us to discover new causal effects between features in
    previously unexplored regions of transcripts, and gene expression in
    natural regimes. We rationally designed, constructed, and analyzed 383 gene
    variants of the viral HRSVgp04 gene ORF, with multiple synonymous mutations
    at key positions along the transcript in the eukaryote S. cerevisiae. Our
    results show that a few silent mutations at the 5'UTR can have a dramatic
    effect of up to 15 fold change on protein levels, and that even synonymous
    mutations in positions more than 120 nucleotides downstream from the ORF
    5'end can modulate protein levels up to 160\%-300\%. We demonstrate that
    the correlation between protein levels and folding energy increases with
    the significance of the level of selection of the latter in endogenous
    genes, reinforcing the notion that selection for folding strength in
    different parts of the ORF is related to translation regulation. Our
    measured protein abundance correlates notably(correlation up to r = 0.62
    (p=0.0013)) with mean relative codon decoding times, based on ribosomal
    densities (Ribo-Seq) in endogenous genes, supporting the conjecture that
    translation elongation and adaptation to the tRNA pool can modify protein
    levels in a causal/direct manner. This report provides an improved
    understanding of transcript evolution, design principles of gene expression
    regulation, and suggests simple rules for engineering synthetic gene
    expression in eukaryotes.

    BACKGROUND: The construction of customized nucleic acid sequences allows us
    to have greater flexibility in gene design for recombinant protein
    expression. Among the various parameters considered for such DNA sequence
    design, individual codon usage (ICU) has been implicated as one of the most
    crucial factors affecting mRNA translational efficiency. However, previous
    works have also reported the significant influence of codon pair usage,
    also known as codon context (CC), on the level of protein expression.
    RESULTS: In this study, we have developed novel computational procedures
    for evaluating the relative importance of optimizing ICU and CC for
    enhancing protein expression. By formulating appropriate mathematical
    expressions to quantify the ICU and CC fitness of a coding sequence,
    optimization procedures based on genetic algorithm were employed to
    maximize its ICU and/or CC fitness. Surprisingly, the in silico validation
    of the resultant optimized DNA sequences for Escherichia coli, Lactococcus
    lactis, Pichia pastoris and Saccharomyces cerevisiae suggests that CC is a
    more relevant design criterion than the commonly considered ICU.
    CONCLUSIONS: The proposed CC optimization framework can complement and
    enhance the capabilities of current gene design tools, with potential
    applications to heterologous protein production and even vaccine
    development in synthetic biotechnology.

    An approach combining fluorescence-activated cell sorting and

    efficiency of start codon recognition for all possible translation
    initiation sites (TIS) utilizing AUG start codons. Using FACS-seq, we
    measured translation from a genetic reporter library representing all
    65,536 possible TIS sequences spanning the -6 to +5 positions. We found
    that the motif RYMRMVAUGGC enhanced start codon recognition and translation
    efficiency. However, dinucleotide interactions, which cannot be conveyed by
    a single motif, were also important for modeling TIS efficiency. Our
    dataset combined with modeling allowed us to predict genome-wide
    translation initiation efficiency for all mRNA transcripts. Additionally,
    we screened somatic TIS mutations associated with tumorigenesis to identify
    candidate driver mutations consistent with known tumor expression patterns.
    Finally, we implemented a quantitative leaky scanning model to predict
    alternative initiation sites that produce truncated protein isoforms and
    compared predictions with ribosome footprint profiling data. The

    The ribosome's interactions with mRNA govern its translation rate and the

    untranslated regions (5' UTRs) are commonly found in bacterial mRNAs,
    though the physical mechanisms that determine how the ribosome binds these

    the ribosome's interactions with structured standby sites, upstream of
    Shine-Dalgarno sequences, and show that these interactions can modulate
    translation initiation rates by over 100-fold. We find that an mRNA's
    translation initiation rate is controlled by the amount of single-stranded
    surface area, the partial unfolding of RNA structures to minimize the
    ribosome's binding free energy penalty, the absence of cooperative binding
    and the potential for ribosomal sliding. We develop a biophysical model
    employing thermodynamic first principles and a four-parameter free energy
    model to accurately predict the ribosome's translation initiation rates for
    136 synthetic 5' UTRs with large structures, diverse shapes and multiple

    The advent of ribosome profiling and other tools to probe mRNA translation
    has revealed that codon bias - the uneven use of synonymous codons in the
    transcriptome - serves as a secondary genetic code: a code that guides the
    efficiency of protein production, the fidelity of translation and the
    metabolism of mRNAs. Recent advancements in our understanding of mRNA decay
    have revealed a tight coupling between ribosome dynamics and the stability
    of mRNA transcripts; this coupling integrates codon bias into the concept
    of codon optimality, or the effects that specific codons and tRNA
    concentrations have on the efficiency and fidelity of the translation
    machinery. In this Review, we first discuss the evidence for
    codon-dependent effects on translation, beginning with the basic mechanisms
    through which translation perturbation can affect translation efficiency,
    protein folding and transcript stability. We then discuss how codon effects
    are leveraged by the cell to tailor the proteome to maintain homeostasis,
    execute specific gene expression programmes of growth or differentiation
    and optimize the efficiency of protein production.

    The biochemical and physical factors controlling protein expression level
    and solubility in vivo remain incompletely characterized. To gain insight
    into the primary sequence features influencing these outcomes, we performed
    statistical analyses of results from the high-throughput protein-production
    pipeline of the Northeast Structural Genomics Consortium. Proteins
    expressed in E. coli and consistently purified were scored independently
    for expression and solubility levels. These parameters nonetheless show a
    very strong positive correlation. We used logistic regressions to determine
    whether they are systematically influenced by fractional amino acid
    composition or several bulk sequence parameters including hydrophobicity,
    sidechain entropy, electrostatic charge, and predicted backbone disorder.
    Decreasing hydrophobicity correlates with higher expression and solubility
    levels, but this correlation apparently derives solely from the beneficial
    effect of three charged amino acids, at least for bacterial proteins. In
    fact, the three most hydrophobic residues showed very different
    correlations with solubility level. Leu showed the strongest negative
    correlation among amino acids, while Ile showed a slightly positive
    correlation in most data segments. Several other amino acids also had
    unexpected effects. Notably, Arg correlated with decreased expression and,
    most surprisingly, solubility of bacterial proteins, an effect only
    partially attributable to rare codons. However, rare codons did
    significantly reduce expression despite use of a codon-enhanced strain.
    Additional analyses suggest that positively but not negatively charged
    amino acids may reduce translation efficiency in E. coli irrespective of
    codon usage. While some observed effects may reflect indirect evolutionary
    correlations, others may reflect basic physicochemical phenomena. We used
    these results to construct and validate predictors of expression and
    solubility levels and overall protein usability, and we propose new
    strategies to be explored for engineering improved protein expression and
    solubility.

    We have analyzed protein-coding sequences of Escherichia coli and find that
    codon-pair utilization is highly biased, reflecting overrepresentation or
    underrepresentation of many pairs compared with their random expectations.
    This effect is over and above that contributed by nonrandomness in the use
    of amino acid pairs, which itself is highly evident; it is much weaker when
    nonadjacent codon pairs are examined and virtually disappears when pairs
    separated by two or three intervening codons are evaluated. There appears
    to be a high degree of directionality in this bias: any codon that
    participates in many nonrandom pairs tends to make both over- and
    underrepresented pairs, but preferentially as a left- or right-hand member.
    We show a relationship between codon-pair utilization patterns and levels
    of gene expression: genes encoding proteins expressed at high levels tend
    to contain more abundant, but more highly underrepresented, codon pairs,
    relative to genes expressed at low levels. The nonrandom utilization of
    codon pairs may be a consequence of their effects on translational
    efficiency, which in turn may be related to the compatibility of adjacent
    aminoacyl-tRNA isoacceptors at the A and P sites of a translating ribosome.

    these effects shape the sequence of natural genes. Finally, we demonstrate
    that reduced RNA structure and not codon rarity itself is responsible for
    expression increases. Our observations resolve controversies over the roles
    of N-terminal codon bias and suggest a straightforward method for
    optimizing heterologous gene expression in bacteria.

    BACKGROUND: Secondary structure forms an important intermediate level of
    description of nucleic acids that encapsulates the dominating part of the
    folding energy, is often well conserved in evolution, and is routinely used
    as a basis to explain experimental findings. Based on carefully measured
    thermodynamic parameters, exact dynamic programming algorithms can be used
    to compute ground states, base pairing probabilities, as well as
    thermodynamic properties. RESULTS: The ViennaRNA Package has been a widely
    used compilation of RNA secondary structure related computer programs for
    nearly two decades. Major changes in the structure of the standard energy
    model, the Turner 2004 parameters, the pervasive use of multi-core CPUs,
    and an increasing number of algorithmic variants prompted a major technical
    overhaul of both the underlying RNAlib and the interactive user programs.
    New features include an expanded repertoire of tools to assess RNA-RNA
    interactions and restricted ensembles of structures, additional output
    information such as centroid structures and maximum expected accuracy
    structures derived from base pairing probabilities, or z-scores for locally
    stable secondary structures, and support for input in fasta format. Updates
    were implemented without compromising the computational efficiency of the
    core algorithms and ensuring compatibility with earlier versions.
    CONCLUSIONS: The ViennaRNA Package 2.0, supporting concurrent computations
    via OpenMP, can be downloaded from http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA.

    MOTIVATION: A consensus sequence for a family of related sequences is, as
    the name suggests, a sequence that captures the features common to most
    members of the family. Consensus sequences are important in various DNA
    sequencing applications and are a convenient way to characterize a family
    of molecules. RESULTS: This paper describes a new algorithm for finding a
    consensus sequence, using the popular optimization method known as
    simulated annealing. Unlike the conventional approach of finding a
    consensus sequence by first forming a multiple sequence alignment, this
    algorithm searches for a sequence that minimises the sum of pairwise
    distances to each of the input sequences. The resulting consensus sequence
    can then be used to induce a multiple sequence alignment. The time required
    by the algorithm scales linearly with the number of input sequences and
    quadratically with the length of the consensus sequence. We present results
    demonstrating the high quality of the consensus sequences and alignments
    produced by the new algorithm. For comparison, we also present similar
    results obtained using ClustalW. The new algorithm outperforms ClustalW in
    many cases.

    the strength of fully induced promoters of the rRNA operons which may be
    close to the functional optimum of a single sequence. By contrast, a
    synthetic 'consensus promoter' belongs to the less efficient signals. Our

    BACKGROUND: The accessibility of RNA binding motifs controls the efficacy

    bacterial sRNA to their respective targets. Similarly, the accessibility of
    the Shine-Dalgarno sequence is essential for translation to start in
    prokaryotes. Furthermore, many classes of RNA binding proteins require the
    binding site to be single-stranded. RESULTS: We introduce a way to compute
    the accessibility of all intervals within an RNA sequence in (n3) time.
    This improves on previous implementations where only intervals of one
    defined length were computed in the same time. While the algorithm is in
    the same efficiency class as sampling approaches, the results, especially
    if the probabilities get small, are much more exact. CONCLUSIONS: Our
    algorithm significantly speeds up methods for the prediction of RNA-RNA
    interactions and other applications that require the accessibility of RNA
    molecules. The algorithm is already available in the program RNAplfold of
    the ViennaRNA package.

    describe the most widely used methods for the expression of recombinant
    proteins in the cytoplasm or periplasm of E. coli, as well as strategies
    for secreting the product to the growth medium. Recombinant expression in
    E. coli influences the cell physiology and triggers a stress response,
    which has to be considered in process development. Increased expression of
    a functional protein can be achieved by optimizing the gene, plasmid, host
    cell, and fermentation process. Relevant properties of two yeast expression
    systems, S. cerevisiae and P. pastoris, are summarized. Optimization of
    expression in S. cerevisiae has focused mainly on increasing the secretion,
    which is otherwise limiting. P. pastoris was recently approved as a host
    for biopharmaceutical production for the first time. It enables high-level
    protein production and secretion. Additionally, genetic engineering has
    resulted in its ability to produce recombinant proteins with humanized
    glycosylation patterns. Several mammalian cell lines of either rodent or
    human origin are also used in biopharmaceutical production. Optimization of
    their expression has focused on clonal selection, interference with
    epigenetic factors and genetic engineering. Systemic optimization
    approaches are applied to all cell expression systems. They feature
    parallel high-throughput techniques, such as DNA microarray,
    next-generation sequencing and proteomics, and enable simultaneous
    monitoring of multiple parameters. Systemic approaches, together with
    technological advances such as disposable bioreactors and microbioreactors,
    are expected to lead to increased quality and quantity of

    A modular and hierarchical DNA assembly platform for synthetic biology
    based on Golden Gate (Type IIS restriction enzyme) cloning is described.
    This enabling technology, termed MIDAS (for Modular Idempotent DNA Assembly
    System), can be used to precisely assemble multiple DNA fragments in a
    single reaction using a standardized assembly design. It can be used to
    build genes from libraries of sequence-verified, reusable parts and to
    assemble multiple genes in a single vector, with full user control over
    gene order and orientation, as well as control of the direction of growth
    (polarity) of the multigene assembly, a feature that allows genes to be
    nested between other genes or genetic elements. We describe the detailed
    design and use of MIDAS, exemplified by the reconstruction, in the
    filamentous fungus Penicillium paxilli, of the metabolic pathway for
    production of paspaline and paxilline, key intermediates in the
    biosynthesis of a range of indole diterpenes-a class of secondary
    metabolites produced by several species of filamentous fungi. MIDAS was
    used to efficiently assemble a 25.2 kb plasmid from 21 different modules
    (seven genes, each composed of three basic parts). By using a parts
    library-based system for construction of complex assemblies, and a unique
    set of vectors, MIDAS can provide a flexible route to assembling tailored
    combinations of genes and other genetic elements, thereby supporting
    synthetic biology applications in a wide range of expression hosts.

    The 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of mRNAs contains elements that affect
    expression, yet the rules by which these regions exert their effect are
    poorly understood. Here, we studied the impact of 5'-UTR sequences on
    protein levels in yeast, by constructing a large-scale library of mutants
    that differ only in the 10 bp preceding the translational start site of a
    fluorescent reporter. Using a high-throughput sequencing strategy, we
    obtained highly accurate measurements of protein abundance for over 2,000
    unique sequence variants. The resulting pool spanned an approximately
    sevenfold range of protein levels, demonstrating the powerful consequences
    of sequence manipulations of even 1-10 nucleotides immediately upstream of
    the start codon. We devised computational models that predicted over 70\%
    of the measured expression variability in held-out sequence variants.
    Notably, a combined model of the most prominent features successfully
    explained protein abundance in an additional, independently constructed
    library, whose nucleotide composition differed greatly from the library
    used to parameterize the model. Our analysis reveals the dominant
    contribution of the start codon context at positions -3 to -1, mRNA
    secondary structure, and out-of-frame upstream AUGs (uAUGs) to phenotypic
    diversity, thereby advancing our understanding of how protein levels are
    modulated by 5'-UTR sequences, and paving the way toward predictably tuning
    protein expression through manipulations of 5'-UTRs.

    properties and these consequent phenotypes were dominated by secondary

    demonstrated its physiological cost using an epigenetic assay. Codon
    composition has a sizable impact on translatability, but only in

    Synonymous codon choice can have dramatic effects on ribosome speed and

    variation in translation elongation by using a feed-forward neural network
    to predict the ribosome density at each codon as a function of its sequence
    neighborhood. Our approach revealed sequence features affecting translation
    elongation and characterized large technical biases in ribosome profiling.
    We applied our model to design synonymous variants of a fluorescent protein
    spanning the range of translation speeds predicted with our model. Levels
    of the fluorescent protein in budding yeast closely tracked the predicted
    translation speeds across their full range. We therefore demonstrate that

    constructs, allowing for a similar purification procedure for most targets,
    and the implementation of high-throughput parallel methods. In most cases,
    these affinity-purified proteins are sufficiently homogeneous that a single

    over 1000 different proteins have been cloned, expressed, and purified in
    tens of milligram quantities over the last 36-month period (see Summary
    Statistics for All Targets, ). Our experience using a hierarchical

    samples but also many three-dimensional structures. As of December 2004,

    65,536 possible TIS sequences spanning the -6 to +5 positions. We found
    that the motif RYMRMVAUGGC enhanced start codon recognition and translation
    efficiency. However, dinucleotide interactions, which cannot be conveyed by
    a single motif, were also important for modeling TIS efficiency. Our
    dataset combined with modeling allowed us to predict genome-wide
    translation initiation efficiency for all mRNA transcripts. Additionally,
    we screened somatic TIS mutations associated with tumorigenesis to identify
    candidate driver mutations consistent with known tumor expression patterns.
    Finally, we implemented a quantitative leaky scanning model to predict
    alternative initiation sites that produce truncated protein isoforms and
    compared predictions with ribosome footprint profiling data. The
    comprehensive analysis of the TIS sequence space enables quantitative
    predictions of translation initiation based on genome sequence.

    In eukaryotes, ribosome profiling provides insight into the mechanism of
    protein synthesis at the codon level. In bacteria, however, the method has
    been more problematic and no consensus has emerged for how to best prepare
    profiling samples. Here, we identify the sources of these problems and
    describe new solutions for arresting translation and harvesting cells in
    order to overcome them. These improvements remove confounding artifacts and
    improve the resolution to allow analyses of ribosome behavior at the codon
    level. With a clearer view of the translational landscape in vivo, we
    observe that filtering cultures leads to translational pauses at serine and
    glycine codons through the reduction of tRNA aminoacylation levels. This
    observation illustrates how bacterial ribosome profiling studies can yield
    insight into the mechanism of protein synthesis at the codon level and how
    these mechanisms are regulated in response to changes in the physiology of
    the cell.
